某些信号链错误可以通过单次室温校准来纠正。AMC131M02 可以存储校准值并使用这些值实时校正结果。可以使用 AMC131M02 实时校正的误差包括偏移误差、增益误差和相位误差。
当输入为零电压（对于电压通道）或零电流（对于电流通道）时，通过确定信号链的测量输出来执行偏移校准。可以针对每个通道测量零输入的 ADC 转换结果并将其记录在外部非易失性存储器中。部署系统后，可以将这些值提供给相应通道的 CHn_OCAL_MSB 和 CHn_OCAL_LSB 寄存器。然后，AMC131M02 在将这些值提供给主机之前从转换结果中减去这些值。
与偏移误差校正类似，系统增益误差可在部署前确定，并可用于实时校正每个通道上的增益误差。增益误差定义为 ADC 传递函数相对于 PGA 增益校正理想值 1 的百分比差异。可以通过测量最大和最小输入信号的结果，找出这些结果之间的差异并除以理想差值来确定该误差。方程式 11 介绍了如何计算增益误差。

要校正增益误差，请将每个偏移校正转换结果除以测得的增益。AMC131M02 根据校准寄存器 一节中所述的方法将每个转换结果乘以存储在 CHn_GCAL_MSB 和 CHn_GCAL_LSB 寄存器中的增益校准系数。主机可以将每个通道的测量反相增益值编程到这些寄存器中，以便针对每个样本自动校正这些值。
AMC131M02 还可以校正传感器引入的系统相位误差。对于该设计，从分流器到 ADC 输入（以及从电压测量电阻分压器）的 PCB 布线会在系统中引入一些相位误差。一些设计使用软件方法进行相位校正，但 AMC131M02 可以实时执行该功能。系统必须首先测量各个通道之间的相位关系。然后 AMC131M02 将一个通道定义为相位 0。随后，可以编辑 CHn_CFG 寄存器中对应于各种其他通道的 PHASEn 位，以校正相对于相位 0 通道的相位关系。"

"判断题：In the Carbon Monoxide Sensor AFE of TPS8804, the CO transimpedance amplifier is a low-offset, low-power op-amp with integrated input, gain, and output 
resistors.",√,"[desc] tps8804 __ CSA Voltage Regulation __ 5 Carbon Monoxide Sensor AFE __ 1 CO Transimpedance Amplifier [desc]
The CO transimpedance amplifier is a low-offset, low-power op-amp with integrated input, gain, and output resistors. Each of these resistors can be disconnected using the COSW register bits if using external resistors. The input resistor limits amplifier current during a CO sensor connectivity test. The gain resistor amplifies the CO sensor signal. Adjust the gain resistor by changing the COGAIN register bits. Use the output resistor with an external capacitor to filter the CO amplifier output signal.
The CO amplifier has two integrated references. A programmable 1.25-mV to 5-mV reference COREF is internally connected to the op-amp positive terminal. A 300-mV reference is connected to the REF0P3 pin. When the millivolt reference is used, the CO sensor must be connected to GND. The millivolt reference is amplified to offset the amplifier output above GND. When the 300 mV reference is used, the reference offsets the CO amplifier output by 300 mV. In general, either reference can be used. The 300-mV reference offers better DC accuracy at the cost of extra power consumption. The 300 mV reference is generated with a reference and op-amp buffer for high precision. The REF0P3 pin must connect to a 1 nF capacitor for stability if it is enabled. The buffer is designed to source and sink small currents as required by the CO amplifier. The 300 mV reference and the 1.25 mV to 5mV reference cannot be enabled simultaneously.
A resistor connected in parallel with the CO sensor prevents charge from accumulating across its terminals. The output of the CO amplifier is connected to the COO pin for continuous monitoring and the AMUX for periodic sampling."
判断题：The ADC12DJ5200SE has an automatic SYSREF calibration feature to alleviate the often challenging setup and hold times associated with capturing SYSREF for giga-sample data converters.,√,"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration [desc]
The ADC12DJ5200SE has an automatic SYSREF calibration feature to alleviate the often challenging setup and 
hold times associated with capturing SYSREF for giga-sample data converters. Automatic SYSREF calibration 
uses the tAD adjust feature to shift the device clock to maximize the SYSREF setup and hold times or to align the 
sampling instance based on the SYSREF rising edge.
The device must have a proper device clock applied and be programmed for normal operation before starting the 
automatic SYSREF calibration. When ready to initiate automatic SYSREF calibration, a continuous SYSREF 
signal must be applied. SYSREF must be a continuous (periodic) signal when using the automatic SYSREF 
calibration. Start the calibration process by setting SRC_EN high in the SYSREF calibration enable register after 
configuring the automatic SYSREF calibration using the SRC_CFG register. Upon setting SRC_EN high, the 
device searches for the optimal tAD adjust setting until the device clock falling edge is internally aligned to the 
SYSREF rising edge. TAD_DONE in the SYSREF calibration status register can be monitored to make sure the 
SYSREF calibration has finished. By aligning the device clock falling edge with the SYSREF rising edge, 
automatic SYSREF calibration maximizes the internal SYSREF setup and hold times relative to the device clock 
and also sets the sampling instant based on the SYSREF rising edge. After the automatic SYSREF calibration 
finishes, the rest of the startup procedure can be performed to finish bringing up the system.
For multi-device synchronization, the SYSREF rising edge timing must be matched at all devices and therefore 
trace lengths must be matched from a common SYSREF source to each device. Any skew between the 
SYSREF rising edge at each device results in additional error in the sampling instance be# 7.3.7 RMS to DC Conversion (Definitions Extracted: None)
The RMS to DC block provides the true RMS value, average value, and peak value of the incoming waveform. The RMS value provides the effective value of the incoming waveform. It is the DC quantity that delivers the same power to a given resistance as the AC signal. The average value is the rectified mean value of the incoming waveform. In the RMS mode, the PEAK and AVG bits of the configuration register should be cleared."

The internal time base of the device is provided by an internal oscillator that is trimmed to less than 0.5% 
tolerance at room temperature. The precision oscillator is the timing source for ADC conversions. At power up, 
the internal oscillator and ADC take roughly 300 µs to reach < 1% error stability. After the clock stabilizes, the 
ADC data output is accurate to the electrical specifications provided in Section 6."

简答题：Please introduce the voltage-output Smart Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) Architecture channels of the DAC53xAxW devices.,"The voltage-output DAC channels of the DAC53xAxW devices consist of a string architecture with a voltageoutput amplifier, as well as an external feedback pin on channel 1.","[desc] dac532a3w __ 3 Feature Description __ 1 Smart Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) Architecture [desc]
The voltage-output DAC channels of the DAC53xAxW devices consist of a string architecture with a voltage-
output amplifier, as well as an external feedback pin on channel 1. Section 6.2 shows the DAC architecture 
within the block diagram that operates from a 3-V to 5.5-V power supply. The DAC has an internal voltage 
reference of 1.21 V. Optionally, use the power supply as a reference. The voltage-output mode supports multiple 
programmable output ranges.
The DAC53xAxW devices support Hi-Z output when VDD is off, maintaining very low leakage current at the 
output pins with up to 1.25 V of forced voltage. The DAC output pin also starts up in high-impedance mode by 
default, making these devices an excellent choice for voltage margining and scaling applications. To change the 
power-up mode to 10 kΩ-GND or 100 kΩ-GND, program the corresponding DAC-PDN-x field in the COMMON-
CONFIG register and load these bits in the device NVM.
The DAC53xAxW devices support comparator mode on channel 1. The FB1 pin acts as an input for the 
comparator. The DAC architecture supports inversion of the comparator output using register settings. The 
comparator outputs can be push-pull or open-drain. The comparator mode supports programmable hysteresis 
using the margin-high and margin-low register fields, latching comparator, and window comparator. The 
comparator outputs are accessible internally by the device.
Channel 2 functions as a current source with a minimum 770-mV headroom at 300-mA output. Make sure the 
junction temperature of the device is kept within the recommended limit while using the current output.
The DAC53xAxW devices include a smart feature set to enable processor-less operation and high integration. 
The NVM enables a predictable start-up. In the absence of a processor or when the processor or software fails, 
the GPIO triggers the DAC output without the SPI or I2C interface. The integrated functions and the FB1 pin 
enable PWM output for control applications."

The turn-off transition has two timing components: turn-off delay time, and turn-off fall time. The turn-off delay

time is from when the drain-source voltage rises to 20% of the bus voltage to when the drain-source voltage 
rises to 80% of the bus voltage. Note that the turn-off fall time is the same as the VDS 20% to 80% rise time. The 
turn-off timing components are independent of the RDRV pin setting, but heavily dependent on the LHB load
