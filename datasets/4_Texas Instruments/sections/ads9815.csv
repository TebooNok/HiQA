6.1 Overview
The ADS981x is an 18-bit data acquisition (DAQ) system with eight-channel analog inputs that can be configured as either single-ended or differential. Each analog input channel consists of an input clamp protection circuit, and a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) with user-selectable bandwidth options. The input signals are digitized using an 18-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), based on the successive approximation register (SAR) architecture. This overall system can achieve a maximum throughput of 2 MSPS/channel for all channels. The device features a 4.096-V internal reference with a fast-settling buffer.
The device operates from 5-V and 1.8-V analog supplies and can accommodate true bipolar input signals. The input clamp protection circuitry can tolerate voltages up to ±18 V. The device offers a constant 1-MΩ resistive input impedance irrespective of the sampling frequency or the selected input range. The ADS981x offers a simplified end solution without requiring external high-voltage bipolar supplies and complicated driver circuits.

"[desc] ads9815 __ Detailed Description __ 1 Analog Inputs [desc]
The ADS981x incorporates dual, simultaneous-sampling, 18-bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Each ADC is connected to four analog input channels through a multiplexer. The device has a total of eight analog input pairs. The ADC digitizes the voltage difference between the analog input pairs AINxP – AINxM."
"[desc] ads9815 __ Detailed Description __ 1 Analog Inputs __ 1 Input Clamp Protection Circuit [desc]
The ADS981x features an internal clamp protection circuit on each of the eight analog input channels. The input clamp protection circuit allows each analog input to swing up to a maximum voltage of ±18 V. Beyond an input voltage of ±18 V, the input clamp circuit turns on and still operates from the single 5-V supply.
For input voltages above the clamp threshold, make sure that the input current never exceeds ±10 mA. A resistor placed in series with the analog inputs is an effective way to limit the input current. In addition to limiting the input current, the series resistor can also provide an antialiasing, low-pass filter (LPF) when coupled with a capacitor. Matching the external source impedance on the AINxP and AINxM pins cancels any additional offset error."

Use a low-jitter external clock with a high slew rate to maximize SNR performance. The ADS981x can be operated with a differential or a single-ended clock input. Clock amplitude impacts the ADC aperture jitter and consequently the SNR."
"[desc] ads9815 __  __ 4 Reference [desc]
The ADS981x has a precision, low-drift voltage reference internal to the device. For best performance, filter the internal reference noise by connecting a 10-µF ceramic bypass capacitor to the REFIO pin. An external reference can also be connected at the REFIO pin and the internal reference voltage can be disabled by writing to PD_REF = 1b in address 0xC1 of register bank 1."

The ADS981x features an internal reference voltage with a nominal output voltage of 4.096 V. On power-up, the internal reference is enabled by default."
"[desc] ads9815 __  __ 4 Reference __ 2 External Reference Voltage [desc]
An external 4.096-V reference voltage, as shown in 图 6-7, can be connected at the REFIO pin with an appropriate decoupling capacitor placed between the REFIO and REFM pins. For improved thermal drift performance, the REF7040 is recommended. To disable the internal reference, set PD_REF = 1b in address 0xC1 in register bank 1. The REFIO pin has ESD protection diodes connected to the AVDD_5V and REFM pins."
"[desc] ads9815 __  __ 5 Sample Synchronization [desc]
As illustrated in 图 5-2, 图 5-3, 图 5-4, and 图 5-5, the SMPL_SYNC pin can synchronize multiple ADCs using an external SYNC signal. The SMPL_SYNC pin is latched in by the falling edge of the sampling clock. The synchronization signal is only required one time during power-up. As illustrated in 图 5-2, 图 5-3, 图 5-4, and 图 5-5, the SYNC signal resets the internal analog channel selection logic and aligns the FCLKOUT signal to the data frame. If no SYNC signal is given, the internal analog channel selection logic and FCLKOUT are not synchronized, which can lead to a different alignment between the sequence of channel output data and FCLKOUT. When using multiple ADCs with the same sampling clock, the SYNC signal makes sure all ADCs sample the same respective analog input channel at the same time."
"[desc] ads9815 __  __ 6 Data Interface [desc]
The ADS981x supports 2-lane and 4-lane mode with single-data-rate (SDR) and double-data-rate (DDR) interface modes. The data interface can be selected using the configuration SPI as described in 表 6-7. The ADC generates the data (D[3:0]), data clock (DCLKOUT), and frame clock (FCLKOUT) in response to the sampling clock signal on the SMPL_CLK input pin. The 18-bit ADC conversion result is output MSB first in a 24-
bit data packet and the last six bits are zeroes.
The data interface signals can be described as:
• D[3:0]: Data output from the ADC. In 4-lane mode all four lanes are used, whereas in 2-lane mode D3 and D1 are used to output ADC data.
• DCLKOUT: Data clock output from the ADC.
• FCLKOUT: Frame clock output from the ADC delimiting each set of 8-channel data. A SYNC pulse is required on power-up or after device reset to align the rising edge of FCLKOUT with channel 0 data output, as described in the Sample Synchronization section.

"[desc] ads9815 __  __ 6 Data Interface __ 2 ADC Output Data Randomizer [desc]
As shown in 图 6-8, the ADS981x features a data output randomizer. When enabled, the ADC conversion result is bit-wise exclusive-ORed (XOR) with the LSB of the conversion result. The LSB of the ADC conversion result has equal probability of being either 1 or 0. As a result of the XOR operation, the data output from the ADS981x is randomized. The ground bounce created by the transmission of this randomized result over the data interface is uncorrelated with the analog input voltage. This uncorrelated transmission helps minimize interference between data transmission and analog performance of the ADC when the PCB layout does not minimize ground bounce."

The test patterns can be enabled by configuring the corresponding register addresses 0x13 through 0x1B in bank 1.
The ADS981x supports the following test patterns:
• User-defined output: User-defined, 24-bit pattern. Separate patterns for ADC A and ADC B; see the User-Defined Test Pattern section.

After the ADS981x is initialized (see 表 6-9), the ADS981x converts analog input voltages to digital output. A 
free-running sampling clock is required for normal device operation; see the ADC Sampling Clock Input section."
"[desc] ads9815 __ 5 Programming __ 1 Register Write [desc]
Register write access is enabled by setting SPI_RD_EN = 0b. The 16-bit configuration registers are grouped in 
three register banks and are addressable with an 8-bit register address. Register bank 1 and register bank 2 can 
be selected for read or write operation by configuring the PAGE_SEL0 and PAGE_SEL1 bits, respectively. 
Registers in bank 0 are always accessible, irrespective of the PAGE_SELx bits because the register addresses 
in bank 0 are unique and are not used in register banks 1 and 2.
As shown in 图 6-9, steps to write to a register are:
1.
Frame 1: Write to register address 0x03 in register bank 0 to select either register bank 1 or bank 2 for a 
subsequent register write. This frame has no effect when writing to registers in bank 0.
2.
Frame 2: Write to a register in the bank selected in frame 1. Repeat this step for writing to multiple registers 
in the same register bank.# 6.5.1 Register Write
Registers in bank 1 and bank 2 are accessible by writing to the bank select register (0x03) in register bank 0. The PAGE_SEL0 and PAGE_SEL1 bits in the bank select register are used to select either register bank 1 or 2. These registers are 8, 16, or 24 bits, respectively. Registers in bank 0 are always accessible, irrespective of the PAGE_SELx bits because the register addresses in bank 0 are unique and are not used in register banks 1 and 2.
As shown in 图 6-9, steps to write to a register are:
1. Frame 1: Write to register address 0x03 in register bank 0 to select either register bank 1 or bank 2 for a subsequent register write. This frame has no effect when writing to registers in bank 0.
2. Frame 2: Write to a register in the bank selected in frame 1. Repeat this step for writing to multiple registers in the same register bank."
"[desc] ads9815 __ 5 Programming __ 2 Register Read [desc]
Select the desired register bank by writing to register address 0x03 in register bank 0. Register read access is enabled by setting SPI_RD_EN = 1b and SPI_MODE = 1b in register bank 0. As illustrated in 图 6-10, registers can be read using two 24-bit SPI frames after SPI_RD_EN and SPI_MODE are set. The first SPI frame selects the register bank. The ADC returns the 16-bit register value in the second SPI frame corresponding to the 8-bit register address.
As illustrated in 图 6-10, steps to read a register are:
1. Frame 1: With SPI_RD_EN = 0b, write to register address 0x03 in register bank 0 to select the desired register bank 0 for reading.
2. Frame 2: Set SPI_RD_EN = 1b and SPI_MODE = 1b in register address 0x00 in register bank 0.
3. Frame 3: Read any register in the selected bank using a 24-bit SPI frame containing the desired register address. Repeat this step with the address of any register in the selected bank to read the corresponding register.
4. Frame 4: Set SPI_RD_EN = 0 to disable register reads and re-enable register writes.
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 to read registers in a different bank."
"[desc] ads9815 __ 5 Programming __ 3 Multiple Devices: Daisy-Chain Topology for SPI Configuration [desc]
图 6-11 shows a typical connection diagram showing multiple devices in a daisy-chain topology.
The CS and SCLK inputs of all ADCs are connected together and controlled by a single CS and SCLK pin of the controller, respectively. The SDI input pin of the first ADC in the chain (ADC1) is connected to the peripheral IN controller OUT (PICO) pin of the controller, the SDO output pin of ADC1 is connected to the SDI input pin of ADC2, and so on. The SDO output pin of the last ADC in the chain (ADC4) is connected to the peripheral OUT controller IN (POCI) pin of the controller. The data on the PICO pin passes through ADC1 with a 24-SCLK delay, as long as CS is active.
The daisy-chain mode must be enabled after power-up or after the device is reset. Set the daisy-chain length in the DAISY_CHAIN_LENGTH register to enable daisy-chain mode. The daisy-chain length is the number of ADCs in the chain excluding ADC1. In 图 6-11, the DAISY_CHAIN_LENGTH = 3.# 6.5.3.1. Register Write With Daisy-Chain
Writing to registers in a daisy-chain configuration requires N × 24-SCLKs in one SPI frame. A register write in a 
daisy-chain containing four ADCs, as shown in 图 6-12, requires 96 SCLKs.
Daisy-chain mode is enabled on power-up or after device reset. Configure the DAISY_CHAIN_LENGTH field to 
enable daisy-chain mode. The waveform shown in 图 6-12 must be repeated N times, where N is the number of 
ADCs in the daisy-chain. 图 6-13 provides the SPI waveform, containing N SPI frames, for enabling daisy-chain 
mode for N ADCs."
"[desc] ads9815 __ 5 Programming __ 3 Multiple Devices: Daisy-Chain Topology for SPI Configuration __ Register Read With Daisy-Chain [desc]
图 6-14 illustrates an SPI waveform for reading registers in a daisy-chain configuration. The steps for reading 
registers from N ADCs connected in a daisy-chain are as follows:
1. Register read is enabled by writing to the following registers using the Register Write With Daisy-Chain:
    a. Write to PAGE_SEL to select the desired register bank
    b. Enable register read by writing SPI_RD_EN = 0b (default on power-up)
2. With the register bank selected and SPI_RD_EN = 0b, the controller can read register data in the following 
two steps:
    a. N × 24-bit SPI frame containing the 8-bit register address to be read: N-times {0xFE, 0x00, 8-bit register 
    address}
    b. N × 24-bit SPI frame to read out register data: N-times {0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF}
The 0xFE in step 2a configures the ADC for register read from the specified 8-bit address. At the end of step 2a, 
the output shift register in the ADC is loaded with register data. The ADC returns the 8-bit register address and 
corresponding 16-bit register data in step 2b."

"[desc] ads9815 __ 3 Register Bank 2 __ 8 Application and Implementation [desc]
Application Information: The following section gives an example circuit and recommendations for using the ADS9817 in a data acquisition (DAQ) system. The ADS9817 includes an integrated analog front-end for each input channel and an 
integrated precision reference with a buffer. As such, this device family does not require any additional external 
circuits for driving the reference or analog input pins of the ADC."
"[desc] ads9815 __ 2 Typical Application [desc]
8.2.1 Data Acquisition (DAQ) System:
The following details are part of the mentioned system timing diagram."
"[desc] ads9815 __ 2 Typical Application __ 2 Design Requirements [desc]
The goal of this application is to design an 8-channel data acquisition system (DAQ) based on the ADS981x with 
an internal reference. 
---table begin---
Table title: Design Parameters
| PARAMETER | VALUE |
|---|---|
| Sampling rate | Up to 2 MSPS/channel |
| ADC reference | Internal, 4.096 V |
| ADC analog input type | Differential |
| ADC analog input range | –5 V to +5 V |
| Output impedance of the source driving the ADC analog inputs | Up to 200 Ω |
---table end---"
"[desc] ads9815 __ 2 Typical Application __ 3 Detailed Design Procedure __ 1 CMOS Data Interface [desc]
The ADS981x features a high-speed CMOS serial interface for ADC data output. ADC data are launched on D[3:0] and the corresponding data clock is launched on DCLKOUT. The DCLKOUT frequency is 192 MHz for 2 MSPS/channel sampling rate (24 SMPL_CLK bits and an 8-MHz SMPL_CLK rate).
High-speed CMOS switching can create ground bounce that adversely impacts the SNR of the ADC. Ground bounce increments with increases in PCB trace capacitance. Minimize the PCB trace length for D[3:0] and DCLKOUT. Place a CMOS buffer, with low input capacitance, close to the ADS981x to minimize the effect of CMOS switching noise."
"[desc] ads9815 __ 3 Power Supply Recommendations [desc]
The ADS981x has three separate power supplies: AVDD_5V, VDD_1V8, and IOVDD. There is no requirement for a specific power-up sequence. The data and configuration digital interfaces are powered by IOVDD. A common 1.8-V supply powers the VDD_1V8 and IOVDD pins."
"[desc] ads9815 __ 4 Layout __ 1 Layout Guidelines [desc]
Avoid crossing digital lines with the analog signal path and keep the analog input signals and the reference signals away from noise sources.
Use 0.1-μF ceramic bypass capacitors in close proximity to the AVDD_5V, VDD_1V8, and IOVDD power-supply pins. Avoid placing vias between the power-supply pins and the bypass capacitors.
Place the reference decoupling capacitor close to the device REFIO and REFM pins. Avoid placing vias between the REFIO pin and the bypass capacitors. Connect the GND, REFM, and IOGND pins to a ground plane using short, low-impedance paths."
