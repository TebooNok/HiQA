Avoid routing traces near irregularities in the reference ground planes. Irregularities include cuts in the ground plane or ground plane clearances associated with power and signal vias and through-hole component leads."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __  [desc]
Provide symmetrically located ground tie stitching vias adjacent to any high-speed signal at an appropriate spacing as determined by the maximum frequency the trace will transport (λ/4). "
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __  [desc]
When high-speed signals must transition to another layer using vias, transition as far through the board as possible (top to bottom is best case) to minimize via stubs on top or bottom of the vias. If layer selection is not flexible, use back-drilled or buried, blind vias to eliminate stubs. Always place two ground vias (“return vias”) close to critical high-speed signal trace via when transitioning between layers to provide a nearby ground return path."

(2)The values given for tTX include deterministic and non-deterministic delays. Over process, temperature, and voltage, the delay will vary. JESD204B accounts for these variations when operating in subclass-1 mode in order to achieve deterministic latency.

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ 1 Overview [desc]
The ADC12DJ5200SE is an RF-sampling, gigasample, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with integrated input 
baluns. The ADC12DJ5200SE can be configured as a dual-channel, 5.2 GSPS ADC or single-channel, 10.4 
GSPS ADC. The -3 dB input frequency range of 2.1 to 6.3 GHz enables direct RF sampling of S-band and C-
band for frequency agile systems.
The device uses a high-speed JESD204C output interface with up to 16 serialized lanes and subclass-1 
compliance for deterministic latency and multi-device synchronization. The serial output lanes support up to 
17.16 Gbps and can be configured to trade-off bit rate and number of lanes. Both 8B/10B and 64B/66B data 
encoding schemes are supported. The 64B/66B encoding schemes support forward error correction (FEC) for 
improved bit error rates. The JESD204C interface is backwards compatible with JESD204B receivers when 
using 8B/10B encoding modes.
A number of synchronization features, including noiseless aperture delay (tAD) adjustment and SYSREF 
windowing, simplify system design for multi-channel systems. Aperture delay adjustment can be used to simplify 
SYSREF capture, to align the sampling instance between multiple ADCs or to sample an ideal location of a front-
end track and hold (T&H) amplifier output. SYSREF windowing offers a simplistic way to measure invalid timing 
regions of SYSREF relative to the device clock and then choose an optimal sampling location. Dual-edge 
sampling (DES) is implemented in single-channel mode to reduce the maximum clock rate applied to the ADC to 
support a wide range of clock sources and relax setup a# 7.2 Functional Block Diagram

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Inputs [desc]
The analog inputs of the device contain an AC coupled balun to convert the single ended input to a differential signal for the ADCs. The input impedance is nominally 50 Ω. The ADCs have internal buffers to enable high input bandwidth and to isolate sampling capacitor glitch noise from the input circuit. The single ended input has no DC path. The device includes internal analog input protection to protect the ADC inputs during overranged input conditions; see the Analog Input Protection section."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Inputs Protection [desc]
The analog inputs are protected against overdrive conditions by internal clamping diodes. The overrange protection is defined for a peak RF input power in the Absolute Maximum Ratings table. Operation above the maximum conditions listed in the Recommended Operating Conditions table results in an increase in failure-in-time (FIT) rate, so the system must correct the overdrive condition as quickly as possible."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Full-Scale Voltage (VFS) Adjustment [desc]
Input full-scale power (PFS) adjustment is available, in fine increments, for each analog input through the FS_RANGE_A register setting (see the INA full-scale range adjust register) and FS_RANGE_B register setting (see the INB full-scale range adjust register) for INA and INB, respectively. The available adjustment range is specified in the Electrical Characteristics: DC Specifications table. Larger full-scale power improves SNR and noise floor (in dBFS/Hz) performance, but can degrade harmonic distortion. The full-scale power adjustment is useful for matching the full-scale range of multiple ADCs when developing a multi-converter system or for external interleaving of multiple ADC12DJ5200SE's to achieve higher sampling rates."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset [desc]
[...]"
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset __ 3 Analog Input Offset Adjust [desc]
In foreground calibration mode, the input offset voltage for each input and for each ADC core can be adjusted through SPI registers. The OADJ_A_FG0_VINx and OADJ_A_FG90_VINx registers (registers 0x344 to 0x34A) are used to adjust ADC core A's offset voltage when sampling analog input x (where x is A for INA or B for INB) where the FG0 register is used for dual channel mode and FG90 is used for single channel mode. 
OADJ_B_FG0_VINx is used to adjust ADC core B's offset voltage when sampling input x. OADJ_B_FG0_VINx applies to both single channel mode and dual channel mode. To adjust the offset voltage in dual channel mode simply adjust the offset for the ADC core sampling the desired input. In single channel mode, both ADC core A's offset and ADC core B's offset must be adjusted together. The difference in the two core's offsets in single channel mode will result in a spur at fS/2 that is independent of the input. These registers can be used to compensate the fS/2 spur in single channel mode. See the Calibration Modes and Trimming section for more information."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset __ 3 ADC Core [desc]
The ADC12DJ5200SE has 3 ADC channels, each consisting of 2 ADC cores. Two of the ADC channels are active while one channel is offline for calibration. The cores are interleaved for higher sampling rates and the channels are swapped on-the-fly for calibration as required by the operating mode. The two active channels can be interleaved to double the sample rate. This section highlights the theory and key features of the ADC cores."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset __ 3 ADC Core __ 1 ADC Theory of Operation [desc]
The differential voltages at the ADC inputs (after the balun) are captured by the rising edge of CLK± in dual-channel mode or by the rising and falling edges of CLK± in single-channel mode. After capturing the input signal, the ADC converts the analog voltage to a digital value by comparing the voltage to the internal reference voltage. If the voltage on negative differential input is higher than the voltage on the positive differential input, then the digital output is a negative 2's complement value. If the voltage on positive differential input is higher than the voltage on the negative differential input, then the digital output is a positive 2's complement value."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset __ 3 ADC Core __ 2 ADC Core Calibration [desc]
ADC core calibration is required to optimize the analog performance of the ADC cores. Calibration must be repeated when operating conditions change significantly, namely temperature, to maintain optimal performance. The device has a built-in calibration routine that can be run as a foreground operation or a background operation. Foreground operation requires ADC downtime, where the ADC is no longer sampling the input signal, to complete the process. Background calibration can be used to overcome this limitation and allow constant operation of the ADC. See the Calibration Modes and Trimming section for detailed information on each mode."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset __ 3 ADC Core __ 3 Analog Reference Voltage [desc]
The reference voltage for the ADC12DJ52# 7.3.3.3 Analog Reference Voltage
The reference voltage for the ADC12DJ5200SE is derived from an internal band-gap reference. A buffered version of the reference voltage is available at the BG pin for user convenience. This output has an output-current capability of ±100 µA. The BG output must be buffered if more current is required. No provision exists for the use of an external reference voltage, but the full-scale input voltage can be adjusted through the full-scale-range register settings."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset __ 3 ADC Core __ 4 ADC Overrange Detection [desc]
If the upper 8 bits of the absolute value equal or exceed the OVR_T0 or OVR_T1 thresholds during the monitoring period, then the overrange bit associated with the threshold is set to 1, otherwise the overrange bit is 0. In dual-channel mode, the overrange status can be monitored on the ORA0 and ORA1 pins for channel A and the ORB0 and ORB1 pins for channel B, where ORx0 corresponds to the OVR_T0 threshold and ORx1 corresponds to the OVR_T1 threshold. In single-channel mode, the overrange status for the OVR_T0 threshold is determined by monitoring both the ORA0 and ORB0 outputs and the OVR_T1 threshold is determined by monitoring both ORA1 and ORB1 outputs. In single-channel mode, the two outputs for each threshold must be OR'd together to determine whether an overrange condition occurred. OVR_N can be used to set the output pulse duration from the last overrange event. 表 7-3 lists the overrange pulse lengths for the various OVR_N settings (see the overrange configuration register). In decimation modes (only in the JMODEs where CS = 1 in 表 7-24), the overrange status is also embedded into the output data samples where the OVR_T0 threshold status is embedded as the LSB along with the upper 15 bits of every complex I sample and the OVR_T1 threshold status is embedded as the LSB along with the upper 15 bits of every complex Q sample. 表 7# 7.3.3.4 Overrange Output Condition and Table Analysis 
In decimation modes (only in the JMODEs where CS = 1), the overrange status is also embedded into the output data samples where the OVR_T0 threshold status is embedded as the LSB along with the upper 15 bits of every complex I sample and the OVR_T1 threshold status is embedded as the LSB along with the upper 15 bits of every complex Q sample. The embedded overrange bit goes high if the associated channel exceeds the associated overrange threshold within the monitoring period set by OVR_N.

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset __ 3 ADC Core __ 6 Overrange Threshold Adjustment [desc]
Typically, the OVR_T0 threshold can be set near the full-scale value (228 for example). When the threshold is triggered, a typical system can turn down the system gain to avoid clipping. The OVR_T1 threshold can be set much lower. For example, the OVR_T1 threshold can be set to 64 (peak input voltage of −12 dBFS). If the input signal is strong, the OVR_T1 threshold is tripped occasionally. If the input is quite weak, the threshold is never tripped. The downstream logic device monitors the OVR_T1 bit. If OVR_T1 stays low for an extended period of time, then the system gain can be increased until the threshold is occasionally tripped (meaning the peak level of the signal is above −12 dBFS)."

ADC cores can generate bit errors within a sample, often called code errors (CER) or referred to as sparkle codes, resulting from metastability caused by non-ideal comparator limitations. The device uses a unique ADC architecture that inherently allows significant code error rate improvements from traditional pipelined flash or successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs. The code error rate of the device is multiple orders of magnitude better than what can be achieved in alternative architectures at equivalent sampling rates providing significant signal reliability improvements."

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset __ 5 Timestamp [desc]
The TMSTP+ and TMSTP– differential input can be used as a time-stamp input to mark a specific sample 
based on the timing of an external trigger event relative to the sampled signal. TIMESTAMP_EN (see the LSB 
control bit output register) must be set to use the timestamp feature and output the timestamp data. When 
enabled, the LSB of the 12-bit ADC digital output reports the status of the TMSTP± input. In effect, the 12-bit 
output sample consists of the upper 11-bits of the 12-bit converter and the LSB of the 12-bit output sample is the 
output of a parallel 1-bit converter (TMSTP±) with the same latency as the ADC core. In the 8-bit operating 
modes, the LSB of the 8-bit output sample is used to output the timestamp status. The trigger must be applied to 
the differential TMSTP+ and TMSTP– inputs. The trigger can be asynchronous to the ADC sampling clock and 
is sampled at approximately the same time as the analog input. Timestamp cannot be used when a JMODE with 
decimation is selected and instead SYSREF must be used to achieve synchronization through the JESD204C 
subclass-1 method for achieving deterministic latency."

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Analog Input Offset __ 6 Clocking __ 3 SYSREF Capture for Multi-Device Synchronization and Deterministic Latency [desc]
The clocking subsystem is largely responsible for achieving multi-device synchronization and deterministic latency. The ADC12DJ5200SE uses the JESD204C subclass-1 method to achieve deterministic latency and synchronization. Subclass 1 requires that the SYSREF signal be captured by a deterministic device clock (CLK±) edge at each system power-on and at each device in the system. This requirement imposes setup and hold constraints on SYSREF relative to CLK±, which can be difficult to meet at giga-sample clock rates over all system operating conditions. The device includes a number of features to simplify this synchronization process and to relax system timing constraints:
The device uses dual-edge sampling (DES) in single-channel mode to reduce the CLK± input frequency by half and double the timing window for SYSREF (see 表 7-5) A SYSREF position detector (relative to CLK±) and selectable SYSREF sampling position aid the user in meeting setup and hold times over all conditions; see the SYSREF Position Detector section Easy-to-use automatic SYSREF calibration uses the aperture timing adjust block (tAD adjust) to shift the ADC sampling instance based on the phase of SYSREF (rather than adjusting SYSREF based on the phase of the ADC sampling instance); see the Automatic SYSREF Calibration section"

The SYSREF windowing block is used to first detect the position of SYSREF relative to the CLK± rising edge and then to select a desired SYSREF sampling instance, which is a delay version of CLK±, to maximize setup and hold timing margins. In many cases a single SYSREF sampling position (SYSREF_SEL) is sufficient to meet timing fo# 7.3.6.3.1 SYSREF Position Detector and Sampling Position Selection (SYSREF Windowing)
The SYSREF windowing block is used to first detect the position of SYSREF relative to the CLK± rising edge and then to select a desired SYSREF sampling instance, which is a delay version of CLK±, to maximize setup and hold timing margins. In many cases a single SYSREF sampling position (SYSREF_SEL) is sufficient to meet timing for all systems (device-to-device variation) and conditions (temperature and voltage variations). However, this feature can also be used by the system to expand the timing window by tracking the movement of SYSREF as operating conditions change or to remove system-to-system variation at production test by finding a unique optimal value at nominal conditions for each system.
This section describes proper usage of the SYSREF windowing block. First, apply the device clock and SYSREF to the device. The location of SYSREF relative to the device clock cycle is determined and stored in the SYSREF_POS bits of the SYSREF capture position register. ADC12DJ5200SE must see at least 3 rising edges of SYSREF before the SYSREF_POS output is valid. Each bit of SYSREF_POS represents a potential SYSREF sampling position. If a bit in SYSREF_POS is set to 1, then the corresponding SYSREF sampling position has a potential setup or hold violation. Upon determining the valid SYSREF sampling positions (the positions of SYSREF_POS that are set to 0) the desired sampling position can be chosen by setting SYSREF_SEL in the clock control register 0 to the value corresponding to that SYSREF_POS position. In general, the middle sampling position between two setup and hold instances is chosen. Ideally, SYSREF_POS and SYSREF_SEL are performed at the nominal operating conditions of the system (temperature and supply voltage) to provide maximum margin for operating condition variations. This process can be performed at final test and the optimal SYSREF_SEL setting can be stored for use at every system power up. Further, SYSREF_POS can be used to characterize the skew between CLK± and SYSREF± over operating conditions for a system by sweeping the system temperature and supply voltages. For systems that have large variations in CLK± to SYSREF± skew, this characterization can be used to track the optimal SYSREF sampling position as system operating conditions change. In general, a single value can be found that meets timing over all conditions for well-matched systems, such as those where CLK± and SYSREF± come from a single clocking device.
SYSREF_SEL must be set to 0 when using automatic SYSREF calibration; see the Automatic SYSREF Calibration section.
The step size between each SYSREF_POS sampling position can be adjusted using SYSREF_ZOOM. When SYSREF_ZOOM is set to 0, the delay steps are coarser. When SYSREF_ZOOM is set to 1, the delay steps are finer. See the Switching Characteristics table for delay step sizes when SYSREF_ZOOM is enabled and disabled. In general, SYSREF_ZOOM = 1 is recommended to be used above fCLK = 3GHz and SYSREF_ZOOM = 0 below fCLK = 3GHz. Bits 0 and 23 of SYSREF_POS are always be set to 1 because there is insufficient information to determine if these settings are close to a timing violation, although the actual valid window can extend beyond these sampling positions.

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration [desc]
The ADC12DJ5200SE has an automatic SYSREF calibration feature to alleviate the often challenging setup and 
hold times associated with capturing SYSREF for giga-sample data converters. Automatic SYSREF calibration 
uses the tAD adjust feature to shift the device clock to maximize the SYSREF setup and hold times or to align the 
sampling instance based on the SYSREF rising edge.
The device must have a proper device clock applied and be programmed for normal operation before starting the 
automatic SYSREF calibration. When ready to initiate automatic SYSREF calibration, a continuous SYSREF 
signal must be applied. SYSREF must be a continuous (periodic) signal when using the automatic SYSREF 
calibration. Start the calibration process by setting SRC_EN high in the SYSREF calibration enable register after 
configuring the automatic SYSREF calibration using the SRC_CFG register. Upon setting SRC_EN high, the 
device searches for the optimal tAD adjust setting until the device clock falling edge is internally aligned to the 
SYSREF rising edge. TAD_DONE in the SYSREF calibration status register can be monitored to make sure the 
SYSREF calibration has finished. By aligning the device clock falling edge with the SYSREF rising edge, 
automatic SYSREF calibration maximizes the internal SYSREF setup and hold times relative to the device clock 
and also sets the sampling instant based on the SYSREF rising edge. After the automatic SYSREF calibration 
finishes, the rest of the startup procedure can be performed to finish bringing up the system.
For multi-device synchronization, the SYSREF rising edge timing must be matched at all devices and therefore 
trace lengths must be matched from a common SYSREF source to each device. Any skew between the 
SYSREF rising edge at each device results in additional error in the sampling instance be# 7.3.7 RMS to DC Conversion (Definitions Extracted: None)

The block diagram for time varying filter mode is not shown.# 7.3.8 Digital Down Converters (DDC)
After converting the analog voltage to a digital value, the digitized sample can either be sent directly to the 
JESD204C interface block (DDC bypass) or sent to the digital down converter (DDC) block for frequency 
conversion and decimation. The DDC block can be used in both dual channel mode and single channel mode. 
Frequency conversion and decimation allows a specific frequency band to be selected and reduces the amount 
of data sent over the data interface. The DDC first mixes the desired band to complex baseband (0 Hz) by 
performing a complex mixing operating using the numerically-controlled oscillator (NCO) as the local oscillator 
(LO). The DDC then low-pass filters the baseband signal to remove unwanted frequency images and any signals 
that may potentially alias into the desired band. It finally decimates (down samples) the data to reduce the data 
rate. Note that the filtering and decimation operations are actually performed as a single operation in the device. 
The DDC is designed with sufficient precision such that the digital processing does not degrade the noise 
spectral density (NSD) performance of the ADC. 图 7-8 illustrates the DDC block in the device in dual channel 
mode while 图 7-9 shows the DDC block of the device in single channel mode. In dual channel mode, the input 
data for each DDC can be selected to come from either ADC channel A or ADC channel B by using the 
DIG_BIND_x SPI registers. Channel B has the same structure with the input data selected by DIG_BIND_B and 
the NCO selection mux controlled by pins NCOB[1:0] or through CSELB[1:0]. Only one DDC is available for use 
in single channel mode.# 7.3.8.1 Numerically-Controlled Oscillator and Complex Mixer
The DDC contains a complex numerically-controlled oscillator (NCO) and a complex mixer. 方程式 3 shows the complex exponential sequence generated by the oscillator.
x[n] = ejωn
(3)
The frequency (ω) is specified by a 32-bit register setting (see the Basic NCO Frequency Setting Mode section and the Rational NCO Frequency Setting Mode section). The complex exponential sequence is multiplied by the real input from the ADC to mix the desired carrier to a frequency equal to fIN + fNCO, where fIN is the analog input frequency after aliasing (in undersampling systems) and fNCO is the programmed NCO frequency."

Fast frequency hopping (FFH) is made possible by each DDC having four independent NCOs that can be controlled by the NCOA0 and NCOA1 pins for DDC A and the NCOB0 and NCOB1 pins for DDC B. Each NCO has independent frequency settings (see the Basic NCO Frequency Setting Mode section) and initial phase settings (see the NCO Phase Offset Setting section) that can be set independently. Further, all NCOs have independent phase accumulators that continue to run when the specific NCO is not selected, allowing the NCOs to maintain their phase between selection so that downstream processing does not need to perform carrier recovery after each hop, for instance.
NCO hopping occurs when the NCO GPIO pins change state. The pins are controlled asynchronously and therefore synchronous switching is not possible. Associated latencies are demonstrated in 图 7-10, where tTX and tADC are provided in the Switching Characteristics table. All latencies in 表 7-10 are approximations only.

synchronization with this method:
1. The device must be programmed for normal operation
2. Set NCO_SYNC_ILA to 1 to enable NCO synchronization using the SYNC signal
3. Set JESD_EN to 0
4. Program FREQAx, FREQBx, PHASEAx, and PHASEBx to the desired settings
5. In the JESD204C receiver (logic device), deassert the SYNC signal by setting SYNC high
6. Set JESD_EN to 1
7. Assert the SYNC signal by setting SYNC low in the JESD204C receiver. This start the code group 
synchronization (CGS) process in 8B/10B encoding modes or arms the trigger in 64B/66B encoding modes.
8. After achieving CGS (or when ready to synchronize), deassert the SYNC signal by setting SYNC high at the 
same time for all ADCs to synchronize the NCOs in each ADC. The SYNC signal must meet the required 
setup and hold times (as specified in the Timing Requirements table)
NCO synchronization using SYSREF (DC coupled):
1. The device must be programmed for normal operation
2. Set JESD_EN to 1 to start the JESD204C link (the SYNC signal can respond as normal during the CGS process)
3. Program FREQAx, FREQBx, PHASEAx, and PHASEBx to the desired settings
4. Verify that SYSREF is disabled (held low)
5. Arm NCO synchronization by setting NCO_SYNC_NEXT to 1
6. Issue a single SYSREF pulse to all ADCs to synchronize NCOs within all devices
NCO synchronization using SYSREF (AC-coupled):
1. The device must be programmed for normal operation
2. Set JESD_EN to 1 to start the JESD204C link (the SYNC signal can respond as normal during the CGS process)

The black portion of the trace shows the pass-band region, or alias-protected region, of the response. The red portion of the trace shows the transition region of the response as well as any frequency regions that will alias into the transition region. The transition region is not alias protected and therefore desired signals should only be placed in the pass-band region of the filter response. The blue portion of the trace shows the frequency regions that will alias into the pass-band after decimation and therefore define the stop-band region of the frequency response. The stop-band attenuation is defined to sufficient filter any undesired images or signals to prevent them from aliasing into the desired pass-band.

---table end---# 7.3.9.2 Scrambler
A data scrambler is available to scramble the data before transmission across the channel. Scrambling is used to remove the possibility of spectral peaks in the transmitted data due to repetitive data streams. The scrambler is optional for 8B/10B encoded modes, however it is mandatory for 64B/66B encoded modes to have sufficient spectral content for clock recovery and adaptive equalization and to maintain DC balance to allow AC coupling of the transmitter to the receiver. The scrambler operates on the data before encoding, such that the 8B/10B scrambler scrambles the 8-bit octets before 10-bit encoding and the 64B/66B scrambler scrambles the 64-bit block before the sync header insertion (66-bit encoding). The JESD204C receiver automatically synchronizes its descrambler to the incoming scrambled data stream. For 8B/10B encoding, the initial lane alignment sequence (ILA) is never scrambled. Scrambling can be enabled by setting SCR (in the JESD204C control register) for 8B/10B encoding modes, but it is automatically enabled in 64B/66B modes. The scrambling polynomial is different for 8B/10B encoding and 64B/66B encoding schemes as defined by the JESD204C standard."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ 9 JESD204C Interface __ 3 Link Layer [desc]
The link layer serves multiple purposes in JESD204C for both 8B/10B and 64B/66B encoding schemes, however there are some differences in implementation for each encoding scheme. In general, the link layer's responsibilities include scrambling of the data (see Scrambler), establishing the code (8B/10B) or block (64B/66B) boundaries and the multiframe (8B/10B) or multiblock (64B/66B) boundaries, initializing the link, encoding the data, and monitoring the health of the link. This section is split into an 8B/10B section (8B/10B Link Layer) and a 64B/66B section (64B/66B Link Layer) to cover the specific implementation for each encoding scheme."

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ 9 JESD204C Interface __ 4 8B/10B Link Layer __ 1 Data Encoding (8B/10B) [desc]
The data link layer converts the 8-bit octets from the transport layer into 10-bit characters for transmission across the link using 8B/10B encoding. 8B/10B encoding for DC balance to allow use of AC-coupling between the SerDes transmitter and receiver, and makes sure a sufficient number of edge transitions for the receiver to reliably recover the data clock. 8B/10B encoding also provides some error detection since a single bit error in a character can result in either not being able to find the 10-bit character in the 8B/10B decoder look up table or an incorrect character disparity."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ 9 JESD204C Interface __ 4 8B/10B Link Layer __ 2 Multiframes and the Local Multiframe Clock (LMFC) [desc]
The frames from the transport layer are combined into multiframes which are used in the process of achieving 
deterministic latency in subclass 1 implementations. The length of a multiframe is set by the K parameter which 
defines the number of frames in a multiframe. JESD204C increases the maximum allowed number of frames per 
multiframe (K) from 32 in JESD204B to 256 in JESD204C to allow a longer multi-frame to ease deterministic 
latency requirements. The total allowed range of K is defined by the inequality ceil(17/F) ≤ K ≤ min(256, 
floor(1024/F)) where ceil() and floor() are the ceiling and floor function, respectively. The local multiframe clock 
(LMFC) keeps track of the start and end of a multiframe for deterministic latency and data synchronization 
purposes. The LMFC is reset by the SYSREF signal to a deterministic phase in both the transmitter and receiver 
to act as a timing reference for deterministic latency. The LMFC clock frequency is given in equation 10 where fBIT 
is the serialized bit rate (line rate) of the SerDes interface and F and K are as defined above. The frequency of 
SYSREF must equal to or an integer division of fLMFC when using 8B/10B encoding modes if SYSREF is a 
continuous signal.
fLMFC = fBIT / (10 × F × K)"
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ 9 JESD204C Interface __ 4 8B/10B Link Layer __ 3 Code Group Synchronization (CGS) [desc]
The first step in initializing the JESD204C link, after the LMFC is deterministically reset by SYSREF, is for the 
receiver to find the boundaries of the encoded 10-bit characters sent across each SerDes lane. This process is 
called code group synchronization (CGS). The receiver first asserts the SYNC signal (set to logic '0') when ready 
to initialize the link. The transmitter responds to the request by sending a stream of K28.5 comma characters. 
The receiver aligns its character clock to the K28.5 character sequence and CGS is achieved after successfully 
receiving four consecutive K28.5 characters. The receiver deasserts SYNC (set to logic '1') on the next LMFC 
edge after CGS is achieved and waits for the transmitter to start the initial lane alignment sequence (ILAS)."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ 9 JESD204C Interface __ 4 8B/10B Link Layer __ 4 Initial Lane Alignment Sequence (ILAS) [desc]
After the transmitter detects the SYNC signal deassert (logic '0' to logic '1' transition), the transmitter waits until 
its next LMFC edge to start sending the initial lane alignment sequence (ILAS). The ILAS consists of four 
multiframes each containing a predetermined sequence. The receiver searches for the start of the ILAS to 
determine the frame and multiframe boundaries. Each multiframe of the ILAS starts with a /R/ character (K28.0) 
and ends with a /A/ character (K28.3) and either can be used to detect the boundary of a multiframe. Each lane 
starts buffering its data in the elastic buffer once the ILAS reaches the receiver, starting with the /R/ character, 
until all receivers have received the ILAS and subsequently release the ILAS from all lanes at the same time to 
align the lanes. The elastic buffer release point is chosen to avoid ambiguity in the release of the.# 7.3.9.4.5 Frame and Multiframe Monitoring
The ADC12DJ5200SE supports frame and multiframe monitoring for verifying the health of the JESD204C link when using 8B/10B encoding. The scheme changes depending on the use of scrambling. The implementation when scrambling is disabled is covered first. If the last octet of the current frame matches the last octet of the previous frame, then the last octet of the current frame is encoded as an /F/ (K28.7) character. If the current frame is also the last frame of a multiframe, then an /A/ (K28.3) character is used instead. Neither an /F/ or /A/ character should occur in a normal data stream, except when replaced by the transmitter for alignment monitoring. When the receiver detects an /F/ or /A/ character in the normal data stream the receiver checks to see if the character occurs at the location expected to be the end of a frame or multiframe. If the character occurs at a location other than the end of a frame or multiframe then either the transmitter or receiver has become misaligned. The receiver replaces the alignment character with the appropriate data character upon reception of a properly aligned /F/ or /A/ character. The appropriate data character is the last octet of the previously received frame. This scheme increases the probability of an alignment character for non-scrambled data streams.
The implementation when scrambling is enabled is slightly different since the octets will be randomized. If the last octet of a frame is 0xFC (before 8B/10B encoding) then the transmitter encodes the octet as an /F/ (/K28.7/) character. If the last octet of a multiframe is 0x7C (before 8B/10B encoding) then the transmitter encodes the octet as an /A/ (/K28.3/) character. The location of the /A/ and /F/ characters is monitored to verify proper frame and multiframe alignment. The receiver replaces the alignment characters by simply replacing an /F/ character with the 0xFC octet and an /A/ character with the 0x7C octet.
The receiver can report an error if multiple alignment characters occur in the incorrect location or do not occur when expected. Upon detection of a frame or multiframe misalignment, the receiver should trigger a link realignment by asserting SYNC. SYSREF should also be reissued to verify that the LMFC in the transmitter and receiver have proper alignment before restarting the link."

This section covers the link layer for the 64B/66B encoding operating modes which includes scrambling of the data, addition of the sync headers (64B/66B encoding), the structure of the block and multiblock, the sync header, cyclic redundancy checking (CRC), forward error correction (FEC), and the use of the Frame Marker Channel (FMC). The 64B/66B link layer provides a lower overhead solution versus the 8B/10B link layer by only adding 2 bits of overhead for every 64 bits of data. This reduction in overhead increases the effective data rate of the link and reduces the link latency. The block and multiblock structure is different from the frame and multiframe structure used in the 8B/10B link layer. Each block contains 64 bits of JESD204C data and 2 bits of overhead for block alignment and block error monitoring. A multiblock contains 32 blocks. The first and last block of each multiblock contains a sync header for block and multiblock alignment. The block sync header contains a 6 bit sync header pattern, a 1 bit block type field, and a 1 bit reserved field. The multiblock sync header is identical to the block sync header except the block type field is set to a different value.# 7.3.9.5 64B/66B Link Layer

A multiblock is a 32 block container which consists of a concatenation of 32 blocks. An extended multiblock is a 
concatenation of multiple multiblocks, where E defines the number of multiblocks in an extended multiblock. A 
frame can be split between blocks and multiblocks, but there must be an integer number of frames in an 
extended multiblock. An extended multiblock is only necessary when a multiblock does not have an integer 
number of frames. If an extended multiblock is not used, because a multiblock contains an integer number of 
frames, then the E parameter is equal to 1 to indicate that there is one multiblock in an extended multiblock. 
Values of E greater than 1 are not supported in ADC12DJ5200SE.
An extended multiblock is analogous to a multiframe in the 8B/10B transport layer. The local extended mutiblock 
clock (LEMC) keeps track of the start and end of a multiblock for deterministic latency and data synchronization 
purposes in the same way the LMFC tracks the start and end of a multiframe in 8B/10B encoding. The LEMC is 
reset by the SYSREF signal to a deterministic phase in both the transmitter and receiver to act as a timing 
reference for deterministic latency. The LEMC clock frequency is defined by 方程式 11 where fBIT is the 
serialized bit rate (line rate) of the SerDes interface. The frequency of SYSREF must equal to or an integer 
division of fLMFC when using 64B/66B encoding modes if SYSREF is a continuous signal.

The sync header contains two bits that are always opposite of each other (either 01 or 10). The JESD204C 
receiver can find the block boundaries by looking for a 66-bit boundary that always contains a 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 
transition. Although 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 transitions will occur at other locations in a block, it is impossible for the 
sequence to appear at a fixed location, other than the proper sync header location, in successive blocks for a 
long period of time. The sync header indicates the start of a block and can be used for block alignment 
monitoring. If a 00 or a 11 bit sequence is see# 7.3.9.5.3.1 Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Mode
The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) mode is available to allow detection of potential bit errors during transmission. Support for the 12-bit word CRC-12 mode is required by JESD204C, while a 3-bit word CRC-3 mode is optional. The device does not support the CRC-3 mode and therefore this section is specific to the CRC-12 mode only. The transmitter computes the CRC-12 parity bits from the scrambled data bits of the 32 blocks of a multiblock. The 12-bit CRC parity word is then transmitted in the sync header stream of the next multiblock. The receiver computes the 12-bit parity word of the received multiblock and compares it against the received 12-bit parity word of the next multiblock. A difference indicates that there is at least one error in the received data bits or in the received 12-bit parity word. The minimum latency to the detection of a bit error in the first data bit of a multiblock is 46 blocks.
The mapping of the sync header stream when using the CRC-12 mode is shown in the table below. CRC[x] corresponds to bit x of the 1

Forward error correction (FEC) is an optional feature in JESD204C and is supported by the device. Whereas 
CRC-12 mode can only detect errors on the link, FEC is able to detect and correct errors to improve the bit error 
rate (BER) for error-sensitive applications. Many applications can tolerate random bit errors, however some 
applications, such as an oscilloscope, rely on long error-free measurements to detect a certain response from 
the device under test (DUT). An error in these applications may result in a false-positive detection of the 
response.
A scrambled multiblock of 32 blocks (2048 bits) is input into the FEC parity bit generator to generate the 26-bit 
parity word. The parity word is sent in the sync header stream of the next multiblock. The receiver then

rs, however some 
applications, such as an oscilloscope, rely on long error-free measurements to detect a certain response from 
the device under test (DUT). An error in these applications may result in a false-positive detection of the 
response.
A scrambled multiblock of 32 blocks (2048 bits) is input into the FEC parity bit generator to generate the 26-bit 
parity word. The parity word is sent in the sync header stream of the next multiblock. The receiver then 
calculates its own 26-bit parity word and calculates the difference between the locally generated and received 
parity word, called the syndrome of the received bits. If the syndrome is 0, then all bits are assumed to have 
been received correctly, while any value other than 0 indicates at least one error in either the data bits or the 
parity word. If the syndrome is non-zero, then it can be used to determine the most likely error and then correct 
the error. The minimum latency from a bit error to detection and correct of a bit error in the first bit of a multiblock 
is 58 blocks.
The mapping of the sync header stream when using FEC mode is shown in 表 7-21. FEC[x] corresponds to bit x 
of the 26-bit FEC word. The 00001 bit sequence at the end of the sync header stream is the pilot signal that is 
used to identify the end of a multiblock. It is possible for a 00001 sequence to appear in another location within 
the sync header stream in FEC mode, however it is improbable to see the 00001 sequence in the same location 
within a sequence of multiple multiblocks. Therefore, in FEC mode it may take more than one multiblock to find 
the end of a multiblock. EoEMB is the end-of-extended-multiblock bit, which is set to 1 for the last multiblock of 
an extended multiblock.

The FEC encoder takes in a multiblock of 32 scrambled blocks (2048 bits) and computes the 26-bit parity word 
using the generator polynomial given by 方程式 13. The 2048 scrambled input bits plus 26 parity bits forms a 
shortened (2074, 2048) binary cyclic code. The (2074, 2048) binary cyclic code is shortened from the cyclic Fire 
code (8687, 8661). This polynomial can correct up to a 9-bit burst error per multiblock.

The full 26-bit FEC parity word generation is shown in 图 7-22. The input is a 2048 bit sequence, built from the 
32 scrambled blocks of a multiblock (sync header is not included). The 26-bit parity word, FEC[25:0], is taken 
from the Sx blocks after the full 2048 bit sequence is processed. The Sx blocks are initialized with 0's before 
processing each multiblock. For more information on the FEC parity word generation, refer to the JESD204C

The 64B/66B link layer does not use an initial lane alignment sequence (ILAS) like the 8B/10B link layer. Therefore, the receiver must use a different scheme to align lanes using the elastic buffer. In 8B/10B mode, the ILAS triggers the elastic buffer to start buffering the data for each lane. After all lanes have started buffering the data, the elastic buffers for each lane are released at a release point determined by the release buffer delay (RBD) parameter and the phase of the LMFC. In 64B/66B mode, the process starts by having all lanes achieve block, multiblock and extended multiblock alignment. Once all lanes have achieved alignment, the receiver can begin buffering data in the elastic buffers at the start of the next extended multiblock on each lane. The data is released at the next release point after all lanes have seen the start of an extended multiblock and have started buffering the data. The release point is defined relative to the LEMC edge and the programmed RBD value, the most intuitive of which is to release on the LEMC edge itself. The release point must be chosen to avoid the region of the LEMC containing variation in the data delay on each lane from startup to startup."

Synchronization of blocks, multiblocks and extended multiblocks by monitoring the sync header of each block and EoMB and EoEMB bit of the sync header stream. A block will always begin with a 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition (sync header). A single missed sync header can occur due to a bit error, however it there are a number of sync header errors within a set number of blocks, then block synchronization has been lost and block synchronization should be reinitialized. It is possible to still have block synchronization, but to lose multiblock or extended multiblock synchronization. Multiblock synchronization is monitored by looking for the EoMB signal, 00001, at the end of the sync header stream for each multiblock. If multiple EoMB signals are erroneous within a number of blocks, multiblock synchronization has been lost and multiblock synchronization should be reinitialized. If an erroneous EoEMB bit is received for multiple extended multiblocks within a number of extended multiblocks, such as a 1 for a multiblock that is not the end of an extended multiblock or a 0 for a multiblock that is the end of an extended multiblock, then multiblock synchronization is lost and extended multiblock synchronization should be reinitialized. If multiblock or extended multiblock synchronizaton is lost, SYSREF should be applied to the erroneous devices to reestablish the LEMC before the synchronization process begins."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ 9 JESD204C Interface __ 6 Physical Layer [desc]
The JESD204C physical layer consists of a current mode logic (CML) output driver and receiver. The receiver consists of a clock detection and recovery (CDR) unit to extract the data clock from the serialized data stream and can contain a continuous time linear equalizer (CTLE) and/or discrete feedback equalizer (DFE) to correct for the low-pass response of the physical transmission channel. Likewise, the transmitter can contain pre-equalization to account for frequency dependent losses across the channel. The total reach of the SerDes links depends on the data rate, board material, connectors, equalization, noise and jitter, and required bit-error performance. The SerDes lanes do not have to be matched in length because the receiver aligns the lanes during the initial lane alignment sequence."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ 9 JESD204C Interface __ 6 Physical Layer __ 1 SerDes Pre-Emphasis [desc]
The device high-speed output drivers can pre-equalize the transmitted data stream by using pre-emphasis to compensate for the low-pass response of the transmission channel. Configurable pre-emphasis settings allow the output drive waveform to be optimized for different PCB materials and signal transmission distances. The pre-emphasis setting is adjusted through the serializer pre-emphasis setting SER_PE (in the serializer pre-emphasis control register). Higher values increase the pre-emphasis to compensate for more lossy PCB materials. This adjustment is best used in conjunction with an eye-diagram analysis capability in the receiver. Adjust the pre-emphasis setting to optimize the eye-opening for the specific hardware configuration and line rates needed."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ 9 JESD204C Interface __ 7 JESD204C Enable [desc]
The JESD204C interface must be disabled through JESD_EN (in the JESD204C enable register) while any of the other JESD204C parameters are being changed. When JESD_EN is set to 0 the block is held in reset and the serializers are powered down. The clocks for this section are also gated off to further save power. When the parameters are set as desired, the JESD204C block can be enabled (JESD_EN is set to 1)."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ 9 JESD204C Interface __ 8 Multi-Device Synchronization and Deterministic Latency [desc]
JESD204C subclass 1 outlines a method to achieve deterministic latency across the serial link. If two devices achieve the same deterministic latency then they can be considered synchronized. This latency must be achieved from system startup to startup to be deterministic. There are two key requirements to achieve deterministic latency. The first is proper capture of SYSREF for which the device provides a number of features to simplify this requirement at giga-sample clock rates (see the SYSREF Capture section for more information).SYSREF resets either the LMFC in 8B/10B encoding mode or the LEMC is 64B/66B encoding mode. The LMFC and LEMC are analogous between the two modes and will now be referred to as LMFC/LEMC.
The second requirement is to choose a proper elastic buffer release point in the receiver. Because the device is an ADC, the device is the transmitter (TX) in the JESD204C link and the logic device is the receiver (RX). The elastic buffer is the key block for achieving deterministic latency, and does so by absorbing variations in the propagation delays of the serialized data as the data travels from the transmitter to the receiver. A proper release point is one that provides sufficient margin again# 7. Deterministic Latency in JESD204C Systems
LMFC and LEMC are analogous between the two modes and will now be referred to as LMFC/LEMC. The second requirement is to choose a proper elastic buffer release point in the receiver. Because the device is an ADC, the device is the transmitter (TX) in the JESD204C link and the logic device is the receiver (RX). The elastic buffer is the key block for achieving deterministic latency, and does so by absorbing variations in the propagation delays of the serialized data as the data travels from the transmitter to the receiver. A proper release point is one that provides sufficient margin against delay variations. An incorrect release point results in a latency variation of one LMFC/LEMC period. Choosing a proper release point requires knowing the average arrival time of data at the elastic buffer, referenced to an LMFC/LEMC edge, and the total expected delay variation for all devices. With this information, the region of invalid release points within the LMFC/LEMC period can be defined, which stretches from the minimum to maximum delay for all lanes. Essentially, the designer must be sure the data for all lanes arrives at all devices after the previous release point occurs and before the next release point occurs."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ Operation in Subclass 0 Systems [desc]
ADC12DJ5200SE can operate with subclass 0 compatibility provided that multi-ADC synchronization and deterministic latency are not required. With these limitations, the device can operate without the application of SYSREF. The internal LMFC/LEMC is automatically self-generated with unknown timing. SYNC is used as normal to initiate the CGS and ILAS in 8B/10B mode."

4. SYSREF causes internal clocks to be realigned
5. An upset that impacts the NCO phase
6. An upset that impacts the internal DDC or JESD204C clocks
When an alarm occurs, a bit for each specific alarm is set in ALM_STATUS. Each alarm bit remains set until the host system writes a 1 to clear the alarm. If the alarm type is not masked (see the alarm mask register), then the alarm is also indicated by the ALARM register. The CALSTAT output pin can be configured as an alarm output that goes high when an alarm occurs; see the CAL_STATUS_SEL bit in the calibration pin configuration register."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ Alarm Monitoring __ 1 NCO Upset Detection [desc]
The NCO_ALM register bit indicates if the NCO in channel A or B has been upset. The NCO phase accumulators in channel A are continuously compared to channel B. If the accumulators differ for even one clock cycle, the NCO_ALM register bit is set and remains set until cleared by the host system by writing a 1. This feature requires the phase and frequency words for each NCO accumulator in DDC A (PHASEAx, FREQAx) to be set to the same values as the NCO accumulators in DDC B (PHASEBx, FREQBx). For example, PHASEA0 must be the same as PHASEB0 and FREQA0 must be the same as FREQB0, however, PHASEA1 can be set to a different value than PHASEA0. This requirement ultimately reduces the number of NCO frequencies available for phase coherent frequency hopping from four to two for each DDC. DDC B can use a different NCO frequency than DDC A by setting the NCOB[1:0] pins to a different value than NCOA[1:0]. This detection is only valid after the NCOs are synchronized by either SYSREF or the start of the ILA sequence (as determined by the NCO synchronization register). For the NCO upset detection to work properly, follow these steps:
1. Program JESD_EN = 0
2. Make sure the device is configured to use both channels (PD_ACH = 0, PD_BCH = 0)
3. Select a JMODE that uses the NCO
4. Program all NCO frequencies and phases to be the same for channel A and B (for example, FREQA0 = FREQB0, FREQA1 = FREQB1, FREQA2 = FREQB2, and FREQA3 = FREQB3)
5. If desired, use the CMODE and CSEL registers or the NCOA[1:0] and NCOB[1:0] pins to choose a unique frequency for channel A and channel B
6. Program JESD_EN = 1
7. Synchronize the NCOs (using SYNC or using SYSREF); see the NCO synchronization register
8. Write a 1 to the NCO_ALM register bit to clear it
9. Monitor the NCO_ALM status bit or the CALSTAT output pin if CAL_STATUS_SEL is properly configured
10. If the frequency or phase registers are changed while the NCO is enabled, the NCOs can get out of synchronization

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Automatic SYSREF Calibration __ Alarm Monitoring __ 3 FIFO Upset Detection [desc]
The FIFO_ALM bit indicates if an underflow or overflow condition has occurred on any of the JESD204C serializer lanes within the synchronizing FIFO between the digital logic block and serializer outputs. The FIFO_LANE_ALM register bits can be used to determine which lane triggered the underflow or overflow condition alarm. If the FIFO pointers are upset due to an undesired clock shift or other single event or incorrect clocking frequencies the FIFO_LANE_ALM bit for the erroneous lane will be set to 1. If the INIT_ON_FIFO_ALM bit is set then the serializers, FIFO and JESD204C block will automatically reinitialize."

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ 4 Device Functional Modes __ 1 Dual-Channel Mode [desc]
ADC12DJ5200SE can be used as a dual-channel ADC where the sampling rate is equal to the clock frequency (fS = fCLK) provided at the CLK+ and CLK– pins. The two inputs, INA and INB, serve as the respective inputs for each channel in this mode. This mode is chosen simply by setting JMODE to the appropriate setting for the desired configuration as described in 表 7-24. The analog inputs can be swapped by setting DUAL_INPUT (see the input mux control register). One channel can be powered down to operate ADC12DJ5200SE as a single channel at the maximum sampling rate of dual channel mode to save power compared to single channel mode operating at half the rate."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ 4 Device Functional Modes __ 2 Single-Channel Mode (DES Mode) [desc]
The ADC12DJ5200SE can also be used as a single-channel ADC where the sampling rate is equal to two times the clock frequency (fS = 2 × fCLK) provided at the CLK+ and CLK– pins. This mode effectively interleaves the two ADC channels together to form a single-channel ADC at twice the sampling rate. This mode is chosen simply by setting JMODE to the appropriate setting for the desired configuration as described in 表 7-24. INA or 
INB, can serve as the input to the ADC, however INA is recommended for highest performance. The analog 
input can be selected using SINGLE_INPUT (see the input mux control register). A calibration needs to be 
performance after switching the input mux for the changes to take effect."

Using Operating Modes, the correct JMODE value can be found for the desired operating mode. The modes listed in Operating Modes are the only available operating modes. This table also gives a range and allowable step size for the K parameter (set by KM1, see the JESD204C K parameter register), which sets the multiframe length in number of frames.
The ADC12DJ5200SE has a total of 16 high-speed output drivers that are grouped into two 8-lane JESD204C links. All operating modes use two links with up to eight lanes per link. The lanes and their derived configuration parameters are described in the Lane Assignement and Parameters table. For a specified JMODE, the lowest indexed lanes for each link are used and the higher indexed lanes for each link are automatically powered down.

The PD input pin allows the devices to be entirely powered down. Power-down can also be controlled by MODE 
(see the device configuration register). To power down only one channel in dual channel mode use the channel 
power down register. The serial data output drivers are disabled when PD is high. For proper operation in 
foreground calibration mode, ADC_OFF in the CAL_CFG register should be programmed to 0x1. When the 
device returns to normal operation, the JESD204 link must be re-established, and the ADC pipeline and 
decimation filters contain meaningless information so the system must wait a sufficient time for the data to be 
flushed."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 6 Test Modes [desc]
A number of device test modes are available. These modes insert known patterns of information into the device 
data path for assistance with system debug, development, or characterization."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 6 Test Modes __ 1 Serializer Test-Mode Details [desc]
Test modes are enabled by setting JTEST (see the JESD204C test pattern control register) to the desired test 
mode. Each test mode is described in detail in the following sections. Regardless of the test mode, the serializer 
outputs (number of lanes, rate) are powered up based on JMODE. Only enable the test modes when the 
JESD204C link is disabled."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 6 Test Modes __ 2 PRBS Test Modes [desc]
The PRBS test modes bypass the JESD204C transport layer and link layer and are therefore neither scrambled 
nor encoded. These test modes produce pseudo-random bit streams that comply with the ITU-T O.150 
specification. These bit streams are used with lab test equipment or logic devices that can self-synchronize to 
the bit pattern. The initial phase of the pattern is not defined since the receiver self synchronizes.
The sequences are defined by a recursive equation. For example, the PRBS7 sequence is defined by:
y[n] = y[n – 6] XOR y[n – 7]
where bit n is the XOR of bit [n – 6] and bit [n – 7], which are previously transmitted bits.

The PRBS9 operation and more are not included in this snippet. The  should continue with further chapters and tables following the rules and format demonstrated above.# 7.4.6.3 Clock Pattern Mode
In the clock pattern mode, the JESD204C transport layer and link layer are bypassed, so the test sequence is neither scrambled nor encoded. The pattern consists of a 16-bit long sequence of 8 ones and 8 zeros (1111 1111 0000 0000) that repeats indefinitely."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 6 Test Modes __ 4 Ramp Test Mode [desc]
In the ramp test mode, the JESD204C link layer operates normally, but the transport layer is disabled and the input from the formatter is ignored. In 8B/10B modes, the pattern begins after the ILA sequence finishes. In 64B/66B mode, the pattern begins after the serializers are initialized. Each lane transmits an identical octet stream that is encoded and scrambled by the link layer. The octet stream increments from 0x00 to 0xFF and repeats. This mode is available for both 8B/10B and 64B/66B modes."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 6 Test Modes __ 5 Short and Long Transport Test Mode [desc]
JESD204C defines both short and long transport test modes to verify that the transport layers in the transmitter and receiver are operating correctly. The ADC12DJ5200SE has three different short transport layer test patterns depending on the N' value of the specified JMODE (see Operating Modes). The short transport layer is only used when control bits are not used. Otherwise, the long transport test mode must be used. ADC12DJ5200SE supports the long transport test mode for all N' = 16 modes, since these modes use control bits. The transport layer test modes are the same for 8B/10B mode and 64B/66B modes with identical N' values, since the transport layer is independent of the link layer."

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 7 Calibration Modes and Trimming [desc]
ADC12DJ5200SE has two calibration modes available: foreground calibration and background calibration. When foreground calibration is initiated the ADCs are automatically taken offline and the output data becomes mid-code (0x000 in 2's complement) while a calibration is occurring. Background calibration allows the ADC to continue normal operation while the ADC cores are calibrated in the background by swapping in a different ADC core to take its place. Additional offset calibration features are available in both foreground and background calibration modes. Further, a number of ADC parameters can be trimmed to optimize performance in a user system.
ADC12DJ5200SE consists of a total of six sub-ADCs, each referred to as a bank, with two banks forming an ADC core. The banks sample out-of-phase so that each ADC core is two-way interleaved. The six banks form three ADC cores, referred to as ADC A, A# 7.4.7 Calibration

The six banks form three ADC cores, referred to as ADC A, ADC B, and ADC C. In foreground calibration mode, ADC A samples INA and ADC B samples INB in dual-channel mode and both ADC A and ADC B sample INA (or INB) in single-channel mode. In the background calibration modes, the third ADC core, ADC C, is swapped in periodically for ADC A and ADC B so that they can be calibrated without disrupting operation. "
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 7 Calibration Modes and Trimming __ 1 Foreground Calibration Mode [desc]
Foreground calibration requires the ADC to stop converting the analog input signals during the procedure. Foreground calibration always runs on power-up and the user must wait a sufficient time before programming the device to be sure the calibration is finished. Foreground calibration can be initiated by triggering the calibration engine. The trigger source can be either the CAL_TRIG pin or CAL_SOFT_TRIG (see the calibration software trigger register) and is chosen by setting CAL_TRIG_EN (see the calibration pin configuration register)."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 7 Calibration Modes and Trimming __ 2 Background Calibration Mode [desc]
Background calibration mode allows the ADC to continuously operate, with no interruption of data. This continuous operation is accomplished by activating an extra ADC core that is calibrated and then takes over operation for one of the other previously active ADC cores. When that ADC core is taken off-line, that ADC is calibrated and can in turn take over to allow the next ADC to be calibrated. This process operates continuously, ensuring the ADC cores always provide the optimum performance regardless of system operating condition changes. Because of the additional active ADC core, background calibration mode has increased power consumption in comparison to foreground calibration mode. The low-power background calibration (LPBG) mode discussed in the Low-Power Background Calibration (LPBG) Mode section provides reduced average power consumption in comparison with the standard background calibration mode. Background calibration can be enabled by setting CAL_BG (see the calibration configuration 0 register). CAL_TRIG_EN must be set to 0 and CAL_SOFT_TRIG must be set to 1. 
Great care has been taken to minimize effects on converted data as the core switching process occurs, however, small brief glitches may still occur on the converter data as the cores are swapped."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 7 Trimming [desc]
A number of ADC parameters are user controllable to provide trimming for optimal performance. These parameters include input offset voltage, ADC gain, interleaving timing, and input termination resistance. The default trim values are programmed at the factory to unique values for each device that are determined to be optimal at the test system operating conditions. The user can read the factory-programmed values from the trim registers and adjust as desired. The register fields that control the trimming are labeled according to the input that is being sampled (INA or INB), the bank that is being trimmed, or the ADC core that is being trimmed. The user is not expected to change the trim values as operating conditions change, however optimal performance can be obtained by doing so. Any custom trimming must be done on a per device basis because of process variations, meaning that there is no global optimal setting for all parts. See the Trimming section for information about the available trim parameters and associated registers.# 7.4.7 Calibration
Calibration requires the ADC to stop converting the analog input signals during the procedure. Foreground calibration always runs on power-up and the user must wait a sufficient time before programming the device to be sure the calibration is finished.

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 7 Trimming __ 3 Low-Power Background Calibration (LPBG) Mode [desc]
Low-power background calibration (LPBG) mode reduces the power-overhead of enabling additional ADC cores. Off-line cores are powered down until ready to be calibrated and put on-line. Set LP_EN = 1 to enable the low-power background calibration feature. LP_SLEEP_DLY is used to adjust the amount of time an ADC sleeps before waking up for calibration (if LP_EN = 1 and LP_TRIG = 0). LP_WAKE_DLY sets how long the core is allowed to stabilize before calibration and being put on-line. LP_TRIG is used to select between an automatic switching process or one that is controlled by the user via CAL_SOFT_TRIG or CAL_TRIG. In this mode there is an increase in power consumption during the ADC core calibration. The power consumption roughly alternates between the power consumption in foreground calibration when the spare ADC core is sleeping to the power consumption in background calibration when the spare ADC is being calibrated. Design the power-supply network to handle the transient power requirements for this mode. LPBG calibration mode is not recommended to be used in single channel operating modes."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ In the 64B/66B modes __ 8 Offset Calibration [desc]
Foreground calibration and background calibration modes inherently calibrate the offsets of the ADC cores; however, the input buffers sit outside of the calibration loop and therefore their offsets are not calibrated by the standard calibration process. In both dual-channel mode and single-channel mode, uncalibrated input buffer offsets result in a shift in the mid-code output (DC offset). Further, in single-channel mode uncalibrated input buffer offsets can result in a fixed spur at fS / 2. A separate calibration is provided to# 7.4.8 Offset Calibration
Foreground calibration and background calibration modes inherently calibrate the offsets of the ADC cores; however, the input buffers sit outside of the calibration loop and therefore their offsets are not calibrated by the standard calibration process. In both dual-channel mode and single-channel mode, uncalibrated input buffer offsets result in a shift in the mid-code output (DC offset). Further, in single-channel mode uncalibrated input buffer offsets can result in a fixed spur at fS / 2. A separate calibration is provided to correct the input buffer offsets.
There must be no signals at or near DC or aliased signals that fall at or near DC to properly calibration the offsets. Requiring the system to be sure of the condition during normal operation, or have the ability to mute the input signal during calibration. The lower bandwidth of the balun will significantly suppress signals near DC, but care must be taken to avoid AC signals near the sample rate from aliasing near DC. Foreground offset calibration is enabled via CAL_OS and only performs the calibration one time as part of the foreground calibration procedure. Background offset calibration is enabled via CAL_BGOS and continues to correct the offset as part of the background calibration routine to account for operating condition changes. When CAL_BGOS is set, the system must be sure there are no DC or near DC signals or aliased signals that fall at or near DC during normal operation. When background offset calibration is used the analog to digital conversion is disturbed by a bandwidth difference. The calibration time is relatively long because the offset calibration engine requires a lot of averaging. A preferred method for offset calibration is to use foreground calibration as a one-time operation so the timing of the disturbing glitch can be controlled. A one time foreground calibration can be performed by setting CAL_OS to 1 before setting CAL_EN. However, this will not correct for variations as operating conditions change.
The offset calibration correction uses the input offset voltage trim registers (see 表 7-66) to correct the offset; therefore, must not be written by the user when offset calibration is used. The user can read the calibrated values by reading the OADJ_x_VINy registers, where x is the ADC core and y is the input (INA or INB), after calibration is completed. Only read the values when FG_DONE is read as 1 when using foreground offset calibration (CAL_OS = 1) and do not read the values when using background offset calibration (CAL_BGOS = 1)."

Each register access requires a specific 24-bit pattern at this input. This pattern consists of a read-and-write (R/W) bit, register address, and register value. The data are shifted in MSB first and multi-byte registers are always in little-endian format (least significant byte stored at the lowest address). Setup and hold times with respect to the SCLK must be observed (see the Timing Requirements table)."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ 1 Using the Serial Interface __ 1 Using the Serial Interface __ 4 SDO [desc]
The SDO signal provides the output data requested by a read command. This output is high impedance during write bus cycles and during the read bit and register address portion of read bus cycles. Each register access consists of 24 bits. The first bit is high for a read and low for a write. The next 15 bits are the address of the register that is to be written to. During write operations, the last eight bits are the data written to the addressed register. During read operations, the last eight bits on SDI are ignored and, during this time, the SDO outputs the data from the addressed register."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ 1 Using the Serial Interface __ 1 Using the Serial Interface __ 5 Streaming Mode [desc]
The serial interface supports streaming reads and writes. In this mode, the initial 24 bits of the transaction specifics the access type, register address, and data value as normal. Additional clock cycles of write or read data are immediately transferred, as long as the SCS input is maintained in the asserted (logic low) state. The register address auto increments (default) or decrements for each subsequent 8-bit transfer of the streaming transaction. The ADDR_ASC bit (register 000h, bits 5 and 2) controls whether the address value ascends (increments) or descends (decrements). Streaming mode can be disabled by setting the ADDR_HOLD bit (see the user SPI configuration register)."

2. The bit-rate and mode of the extra lanes are set by JMODE and JTEST (see exception below).
3. If a lane is enabled by this register (and was not enabled by JMODE), and JTEST is 0 or 5, the extra lanes will use an octet ramp (same as JTEST=4).

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ 1 Application Information [desc]
ADC12DJ5200SE can be used in a wide range of applications including radar, satellite communications, test 
equipment (communications testers), and software-defined radios (SDRs). The wide input bandwidth enables 
direct RF sampling to at least 8 GHz and the high sampling rate allows signal bandwidths of greater than 5 GHz. 
The Typical Applications section describes two configurations that meet the needs of a number of these 
applications."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ 2 Typical Applications __ 1 Wideband RF Sampling Receiver [desc]
This section demonstrates the use of ADC12DJ5200SE as a wideband RF sampling receiver. The solution is 
flexible and can be used as either a 2-channel receiver (such as a diversity receiver) or as a single channel 
receiver allowing double the signal bandwidth. The ADC is driven by single-ended RF amplifiers connected 
through an anti-alias filter to the ADC input. The device includes digital down-converters (DDCs) in both single-
channel and dual-channel modes to mix the desired frequency band to baseband and down-sample the data to 
reduce the interface rate. The block diagram for the wideband RF sampling receiver is shown in 图 8-1 with the 
device is configured in single-channel mode for maximum signal bandwidth.

The ADC12DJ5200SE clock inputs must be AC-coupled to the device for rated performance. The clock source must have extremely low jitter (integrated phase noise) to enable rated performance. Recommended clock synthesizers include LMX2594 and LMX2572.
The JESD204C data converter system (ADC plus logic device) requires additional SYSREF and device clocks. LMK04832, LMK04828, LMK04826, and LMK04821 devices are suitable to generate these clocks. Depending on the ADC clock frequency and jitter requirements, this device can also be used as the system clock synthesizer or as a device clock and SYSREF distribution device when multiple ADC12DJ5200SE devices are used in a system. For clock frequencies higher than 3.2 GHz, LMX2594 and LMX2572 can supply both the device clock and SYSREF from a single device as demonstrated in 图 8-1."

1. Power-up or reset the device.
2. Apply a stable device CLK signal at the desired frequency.
3. Perform a software reset by toggling SOFT_RESET to 1. Wait at least 1 µs before continuing.
4. Program JESD_EN = 0 to stop the JESD204C state machine and allow setting changes.
5. Program CAL_EN = 0 to stop the calibration state machine and allow setting changes.
6. Program the desired JMODE.

The device requires two different power-supply voltages. 1.9-V DC is required for the VA19 power bus and 1.1-V
DC is required for the VA11 and VD11 power buses. The power-supply voltages must be low noise and provide
the needed current to achieve rated device performance. There are two recommended power supply
architectures:"

This approach provides the best efficiency, but care must be taken for switching noise to be minimized to prevent degraded
ADC performance. This approach is best described in the following application note: Powering Sensitive

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Step down using high-efficiency switching converters, followed by a second stage of regulation to provide __ Power Supply Considerations [desc]
* Decouple all power supply rails and bus voltages as they come onto the system board and near/at the ADC 
itself. Typically, one decoupling capacitor per power supply pin is sufficient unless specified in the datasheet
or EVM assembly.
* Remember that approximately 20 dB/decade noise suppression is gained for each additional filtering stage.
* Decouple for both high and low frequencies, which might require multiple capacitor values.
* Series ferrite beads are commonly used at the power plain entry point. This should be done for each 
individual supply voltage on the system board whether it comes from an LDO or a switching regulator.
* For added capacitance, use tightly stacked power and ground plane pairs (≤4 mil spacing) this adds inherent
high-frequency (>500MHz) decoupling to the PCB design.
* Keep supplies away from sensitive analog circuitry such as the front-end RF stage of the ADC and high-
speed clocking & digital circuits if possible.
* Some switcher regulator circuitry/components could be located on the opposite side of the PCB for added
isolation.
* Follow the IC manufacture recommendations; if they are not directly stated in the application note or data
sheet, then study the evaluation board. These are great vehicles to learn from. Applying these points above
can help provide a solid power supply design yielding datasheet performance in many applications.
Each application will have different tolerances for noise on the supply voltage so understanding these trades is
best described in the following two application notes for more details:"

"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ Clutter-free power supplies for RF converters in radar applications (Part 2) __ 1 Power Sequencing [desc]
The voltage regulators must be sequenced using the power-good outputs and enable inputs to be sure the Vx11 regulator is enabled after the VA19 supply is good. Similarly, as soon as the VA19 supply drops out of regulation on power-down, the Vx11 regulator is disabled.
The general requirement for the ADC is that VA19 ≥ Vx11 during power-up, operation, and power-down.
TI also recommends that VA11 and VD11 are derived from a common 1.1-V regulator. This recommendation makes sure that all 1.1-V blocks are at the same voltage, and no sequencing problems exist between these supplies. Also use ferrite bead filters to isolate any noise on the VA11 and VD11 buses from affecting each other."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __ 5 Layout __ 1 Layout Guidelines [desc]
There are many critical signal connections that require specific care and attention during PC board design:
1. Analog input signals
2. CLK and SYSREF
3. JESD204C data outputs
4. Power connections
5. Power and grounding strategy
In general, there are many considerations to take note of when developing a high-speed PCB design. Here are a few recommendations to follow for any high-speed PCB design:
1. Route using loosely coupled 100-Ω differential traces when possible on the digital outputs. This routing minimizes impact of corners and length-matching serpentines on pair impedance.
2. Provide adequate pair-to-pair spacing to minimize crosstalk, especially with loosely coupled differential traces. Tightly coupled differential traces may be used to reduce self-radiated noise or to improve neighboring trace noise immunity when adequate spacing cannot be provided.
3. Provide adequate ground plane pour spacing to minimize coupling with the high-speed traces. Any ground plane pour must have sufficient via connections to the main ground plane of the board. Do not use floating or poorly connected ground pours.
4. Use smoothly radiused corners and avoid 45- or 90-degree bends to reduce impedance mismatches on all high-speed inputs/outputs for both analog and digital signal traces.

Use smoothly radiused corners and avoid 45- or 90-degree bends to reduce impedance mismatches on all high-speed inputs/outputs for both analog and digital signal traces."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __  [desc]
Incorporate any ground plane cutouts necessary at component landing pads, ie – SMA connectors, baluns, etc., to avoid impedance discontinuities at these locations. Cut-outs below these landing pads on one or multiple ground planes to achieve a pad size or stackup height that achieves the needed 50 Ω, single-ended impedance. "
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __  [desc]
Pay particular attention to potential coupling between JESD204x data output routing and the analog input routing. Switching noise from the JESD204x outputs can couple into the analog input traces and show up as wideband noise due to the high input bandwidth of the ADC. Route the JESD204x data outputs on a separate layer, if possible, from the ADC input traces to avoid noise coupling."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __  [desc]
Keep in mind, a reduction in the clock amplitude may degrade ADC noise performance, make sure the clock signal has adequate drive strength, especially at high input frequencies. To help avoid this, keep the clock source close to the ADC if using a passive balun to drive or interface with the sampling clock pins of the converter. If trace routes are longer than a few inches it might be necessary to implement impedance matching at the ADC’s sampling clock input pins."
"[desc] adc12dj5200se __  [desc]
In addition, TI recommends the following PCB fabrication considerations for high-speed PCB designs:
1. Use high quality dielectric materials for any critical signal layers within the PCB stack-up. Typically, the top and bottom layers are the most critical and more board houses can implement a mix of high and standard 
quality dielectrics, also known as a hybrid stack-up.
2. Use multiple power layers if necessary to provide a robust power delivery system to the converter.
3. Use multiple ground, power, ground layer stacks within the PCB to develop high frequency decoupling within the PCB itself, it is recommended these layers are 4mils or less.
4. Use a solid ground plane, do not split or “slot” the ground plane to create an analog vs. digital barrier or divider. This typically causes more harm to the signal integrity and noise performance than it helps."
