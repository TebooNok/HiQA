"[desc] tps281c100 __ Description [desc]
TPS281C100 is a single channel smart high-side switch designed to meet the requirements of industrial control systems. 
The low RON minimizes device power dissipation, driving a wide range of output load current up to 60-V DC operation range improves system robustness.
The device integrates protection features such as thermal shut down, output clamp, and current limit. These features improve system robustness during fault events such as short circuit. 
TPS281C100 implements an adjustable current limiting circuit that improves the reliability of the system by reducing inrush current when driving large capacitive loads and minimizing overload current. 
In order to drive high inrush current loads such as lamps or fast charging capacitive loads, TPS281C100A implements an inrush current time period with a higher level of allowed current. 
The device also provides an accurate load current sense that allows for improved load diagnostics such as overload and open-load detection enabling better predictive maintenance.
TPS281C100 is available in a small 14-pin, 4.4-mm × 5-mm HTSSOP leaded package with 0.65-mm pin pitch and 12-pin, 4-mm × 4-mm WSON with 0.5-mm pin pitch minimizing the PCB footprint."

"[desc] tps281c100 __ 1 Overview [desc]
The TPS281C100 is a single-channel, fully-protected, high-side power switch with an integrated NMOS power 
FET and charge pump. Full diagnostics and high-accuracy current-sense features enable intelligent control 
of the load. Low logic high threshold, VIH, of 1.5V on the input pins allow use of MCU's down to 1.8V. A 
programmable current-limit function greatly improves the reliability of the whole system. The device diagnostic 
reporting has two pins to support both digital status and analog current-sense output, both of which can be set 
to the high-impedance state when diagnostics are disabled, for multiplexing the MCU analog or digital interface 
among devices.
The digital status report is implemented with an open-drain structure on the fault pin. When a fault condition 
occurs, the pin is pulled down to GND. An external pullup is required to match the microcontroller supply level. 
High-accuracy current sensing allows a better real-time monitoring effect and more-accurate diagnostics without 
further calibration. A current mirror is used to source 1 / KSNS of the load current, which is reflected as voltage 
on the SNS pin. KSNS is a constant value across temperature and supply voltage. The SNS pin can also report 
a fault by forcing a voltage of VSNSFH that scales with the diagnostic enable voltage so that the max voltage 
seen by the system.# 8.2 Functional Block Diagram

"[desc] tps281c100 __ 4 Working Mode [desc]
The four working modes in the device are normal mode, normal mode with diagnostics, idle mode and idle mode 
with diagnostics.
Normal mode is when EN is high and DIAG_EN is low. In this mode, VS is having quiescent current of IQ,VS, and 
the main FET is ON. With DIAG_EN low, no current sense information is available through the SNS pin.
Normal mode with Diagnostics is when both EN and DIAG_EN is high. In this mode, VS is having quiescent 
current of IQ,VS_DIAG, and the main FET is ON. With DIAG_EN high, current sense information will be available 
through the SNS pin.
Idle mode is when both EN and DIAG_EN low. In this mode, main FET is OFF, and VS is consuming a current of 
IIDLE,VS. There is extra current consumed in this state compared to the traditional shutdown state, due to having 
EFT detection circuitry being active. Additionally, there is a current sink at the output always active to keep the 
output near 0V. The output sink can sink up to IOUT(OFF,SINK).

"[desc] tps281c100 __ Feature Description __ Accurate Current Sense [desc]
The current-sense function is internally implemented, which allows a better real-time monitoring effect and more-accurate diagnostics without further calibration. A current mirror is used to source 1 / KSNS of the load current, flowing out to the external resistor between the SNS pin and GND, and reflected as voltage on the SNS pin.
KSNS is the ratio of the output current and the sense current. The accuracy values of KSNS quoted in the electrical characteristics do take into consideration temperature and supply voltage. Each device was internally calibrated while in production, so post-calibration by users is not required in most cases.
The maximum voltage out on the SNS pin is clamped to VSNSFH which is the fault voltage level. In order to make sure that this voltage is not higher than the system can tolerate, TI has correlated the voltage coming in on the DIAG_EN pin with the maximum voltage out on the SNS pin. If DIAG_EN is between VIH and 3.3 V, the maximum output on the SNS pin will be ~3.3 V. However, if the voltage at DIAG_EN is above 3.3 V, then the fault SNS voltage, VSNSFH, will track that voltage up to 5 V. This is done because the GPIO voltage output that is powering the diagnostics through DIAG_EN, will be close to the maximum acceptable ADC voltage within the same microcontroller. Therefore, the sense resistor value, RSNS, can be chosen to maximize the range of currents needed to be measured by the system. The RSNS value should be chosen based on application need. The maximum usable RSNS value is bounded by the ADC minimum acceptable voltage, VADC,min, for the smallest load current needed to be measured by the system, ILOAD,min. The minimum acceptable RSNS value has to ensure the VSNS voltage is below the VSNSFH value so that the system can determine faults. This difference between the maximum readable current through the SNS pin, ILOAD,max × RSNS, and the VSNSFH is called the headroom voltage, VHR. The headroom voltage is determined by the system but is important so that there is a difference between the maximum readable current and a fault condition. Therefore, the minimum RSNS value has to be the VSNSFH minus the VHR times the sense current ratio, KSNS divided by the maximum load current, ILOAD,max.# 1. Current-Sense and Current-Limit Block Diagram
By the system, ILOAD,min. The minimum acceptable RSNS value has to ensure the VSNS voltage is below the VSNSFH value so that the system can determine faults. This difference between the maximum readable current through the SNS pin, ILOAD,max × RSNS, and the VSNSFH is called the headroom voltage, VHR. The headroom voltage is determined by the system but is important so that there is a difference between the maximum readable current and a fault condition. Therefore, the minimum RSNS value has to be the VSNSFH minus the VHR times the sense current ratio, KSNS divided by the maximum load current the system needs to measure, ILOAD,max. This boundary equation can be seen in Equation 1.
VADC,min × KSNS / ILOAD,min ≤ RSNS ≤ (VSNSFH – VHR) × KSNS / ILOAD,max (1)"
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Voltage Indication on the Current-Sense Pin [desc]
The maximum current the system wants to read, ILOAD,max, needs to be below the current limit threshold because once the current limit threshold is tripped the VSNS value will go to VSNSFH. Additionally, currents being measured should be below 4 A to ensure that the current sense output is not saturated."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Current-Sense and Current-Limit Block Diagram Explanation [desc]
Since this scheme adapts based on the voltage coming in from the MCU. There is no need to have a zener diode on the SNS pin to protect from high voltages."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ High Accuracy Sense Mode [desc]
In some applications, having accurate current sensing at lower load currents can be critical to distinguish between a real load and a fault scenario such as an open load condition(Wire-Break). To address this challenge, TPS281C100 implements a high accuracy sense mode that enables customers to achieve ±12.5% at 4mA load. This mode will be activated when diagnostics are enabled(DIAG_EN=HI), OL_ON = HI and ILoad<IKSNS2_EN. To achieve this high accuracy , the device increases its main path resistance to improve its sense accuracy while high accuracy sensing is active. TI recommends users to disable this accuracy sense mode by setting OL_ON=LO if the load starts to increase beyond 20 mA. This will proactively prevent any higher power dissipation states."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Sudden Load Step [desc]
In other scenarios such as a sudden load step where the system might not be fast enough to react to the change in SNS output current. For this case, in order to prevent a high-power dissipation state given by the increased resistance. TPS281C100 senses the load flowing through the VS to VOUT path to be less than IKSNS2_DIS. If the load increases beyond IKSNS2_DIS the FET resistance will revert back to its lowest resistance and high accuracy sense mode will be disabled. This will result in FAULT being asserted to signal that high accuracy sense mode has been disabled. This will ensure the lowest power dissipation when higher loads are being driven. In addition to this, the user can PWM the OL_ON pin to disable the high resistance mode and minimize power losses further."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Measurement of Lower Load Currents [desc]
However, even if accuracy is achieved by the device; Depending on the current sense ratio, system ADCs can struggle to measure lower load currents accurately due to the low voltages that would need to be read by the ADC. As an example, a 6 mA ILoad will be represented as ~7.5 mV using RSNS=1kOhm with a current sense."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ High Load Currents [desc]
The high accuracy sense mode has been disabled. This will ensure the lowest power dissipation when higher loads are being driven. In addition to this, the user can PWM the OL_ON pin to disable the high resistance mode and minimize power losses further."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Lower Load Currents Measurement [desc]
However, even if accuracy is achieved by the device; Depending on the current sense ratio, system ADCs can struggle to measure lower load currents accurately due to the low voltages that would need to be read by the ADC. As an example, a 6 mA ILoad will be represented as ~7.5 mV using RSNS=1kOhm with a current sense ratio of 800. For a 10-bit 5 V ADC the 7.5 mV output is just over 1 LSB (4.88 mV). This does not provide enough margin to accurately measure this current for the ADC and likely a higher resolution would need to be used."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Sensing Low Load Currents [desc]
Therefore, in order to enable lower ADC resolution requirements and to accurately sense low load currents when operating in high accuracy sense mode, TPS281C100 decreases its current sense ratio to 24. With a sense ratio of 24, the 6 mA ILoad will be represented as 250 mV using RSNS=1kOhm when operating in high accuracy sense mode. This equals to 51 LSBs of margin for the same 10-bit ADC or even for an 8-bit ADC the output would still provide > 12 LSBs of headroom."

"[desc] tps281c100 __ Programmable Current Limit [desc]
A high-accuracy current limit allows higher reliability, which protects the power supply during short circuit or power up. Also, it can save system costs by reducing PCB traces, connector size, and the capacity of the preceding power stage. Current limit offers protection from overstressing to the load and integrated power FET. Current limit holds the current at the set value, and pulls up the SNS pin to VSNSFH and asserts the FAULT pin as diagnostic reports. "
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Channels in the Device [desc]
The two current-limit thresholds are:
External programmable current limit: An external resistor, RILIMis used to set the channel current limit. When the current through the device exceeds ICL (current limit threshold), a closed loop steps in immediately. VGS voltage regulates accordingly, leading to the VDS voltage regulation. When the closed loop is set up, the current is clamped at the set value. The external programmable current limit provides the capability to set the current-limit value by application. Additionally this value can be dynamically changed by changing the resistance on the ILIM pin. This can be seen in the Applications Section.
Internal current limit: ILIM pin open or pin shorted to ground -- If the external current limit function is not used, the device operates at the factory default peak current limit.# 1. Introduction

When the closed loop is set up, the current is clamped at the set value. The external programmable current limit provides the capability to set the current-limit value by application. Additionally this value can be dynamically changed by changing the resistance on the ILIM pin. This can be seen in the Applications Section."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Internal Current Limit [desc]
Internal current limit: ILIM pin open or pin shorted to ground -- If the external current limit is out of range on the lower end or the ILIM pin is shorted to ground, the internal current limit is fixed and typically 0.5A. This works as a safety power limiting mechanism during failures with shorts or open connections with PCB overstress.
Both the internal current limit (Ilim,nom) and external programmable current limit are always active when VS is powered and EN is high. The lower value one (of ILIM and the external programmable current limit) is applied as the actual current limit. The typical deglitch time for the current limit to assert is 2.5µs.
Note that if a GND network is used (which leads to the level shift between the device GND and board GND), the ILIM pin must be connected with device GND. Calculate RLIM from the typical ICL value desired with Equation 2.
RILIM = KCL / ICL
(2)"
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Consideration for Current Limit [desc]
The RILIM value calculated here will correspond to a typical value of the current limit. For the RILIM value listed in the data sheet, the min and max current limit values are given in the electrical characteristic table. For any RILIM values in between, linear interpolation can be used to estimate the min and max values.
The minimum value for the current limit listed in the electrical characteristic table includes the variation for FAULT assertion. When designing the module to ensure the FAULT signal is not asserted during nominal operation, the minimum current limit needs to be above the nominal operation current. An example is given in Section 9.2.2.1.
For better protection from a hard short-to-GND condition (when VS and input are high and a short to GND happens suddenly), an open-loop fast-response behavior is set to turn off the channel, before the current-limit closed loop is set up. With this fast response, the device can achieve better inrush-suppression performance."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Short-Circuit and Overload Protection [desc]
8.5.2.1 Short-Circuit and Overload Protection
TPS281C100 provides output short-circuit protection to ensure that the device will prevent current flow in the event of a low impedance path to GND, removing the risk of damage or significant supply droop. The device is guaranteed to protect against short-circuit events regardless of the state of the ILIM pins and with up to 60 V supply at 125°C.
On-State Short-Circuit Behavior shows the behavior of TPS281C100 when a short-circuit occurs and the device is in the on-state and already outputting current. When the internal pass FET is fully enabled, the current clamping settling time is slower so to ensure overshoot is limited, the device implements a fast trip level at a level IOVCR. When this fast trip threshold is hit, the device immediately shuts off for a short period of time before quickly re-enabling and clamping the current to ICL level after a brief transient overshoot to the higher peak current (ICL_ENPS) level. The device will then keep the current clamped at the regulation current limit until the thermal shutdown temperature is hit and the device will safely shut-off.

"[desc] tps281c100 __ Short-Circuit and Overload Protection __ 1 Overload Behavior [desc]
Overload Behavior shows the behavior of the TPS281C100 when there is a small change in impedance that sends the load current above the ICL threshold. The current rises to ICL_LINPK above the regulation level. Then the current limit regulation loop kicks in and the current drops to the ICL value.
In all of these cases, the internal thermal shutdown is safe to hit repetitively. There is no device risk or lifetime reliability concerns from repeatedly hitting this thermal shutdown level."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Short-Circuit and Overload Protection __ 1 Overload Behavior __ 2 Capacitive Charging [desc]
Capacitive Charging Circuit shows the typical set up for a capacitive load application and the internal blocks that function when the device is used. Note that all capacitive loads will have an associated ""load"" in parallel with the capacitor that is described as a resistive load but in reality it can be inductive or resistive.

The first thing to check is that the nominal DC current, INOM, is acceptable for the TPS281C100 device. This can easily be done by taking the RθJA from the Thermal Section and multiplying the RON of the TPS281C100 and the INOM with it, add the ambient temperature and if that value is below the thermal shutdown value the device can operate with that load current. For an example of this calculation see the Applications Section.
The second key care about for this application is to make sure that the capacitive load can be charged up completely without the device hitting thermal shutdown. This is because if the device hits thermal shutdown during the charging, the resistive nature of the load in parallel with the capacitor will start to discharge the capacitor over the duration the TPS281C100 is off. Note that there are some application with high enough load impedance that the TPS281C100 hitting thermal shutdown and trying again is acceptable; however, for the majority of applications the system should be designed so that the TPS281C100 does not hit thermal shutdown while charging the capacitor.
With the current clamping feature of the TPS281C100, capacitors can be charged up at a lower inrush current than other high current limit switches. This lower inrush current means that the capacitor will take a little longer to charge all the way up. However, to minimize this longer charge time during startup, TPS281C100A implements an inrush current handling feature described in Figure 8-8. When the EN pin goes high to turn on the high side switch, the device will default its current limit threshold to ILIM_STARTUP for a duration of ILIM_STARTUP_DELAY. During this delay period, a capacitive load can be charged at a higher rate than what typical ICL would permit. After this delay the current limit is restored to its set value.# 8.5.2 Inrush Current Handling

However, to minimize this longer charge time during startup, TPS281C100A implements an inrush current handling feature described in Figure 8-8. When the EN pin goes high to turn on the high side switch, the device will default its current limit threshold to ILIM_STARTUP for a duration of ILIM_STARTUP_DELAY. During this delay period, a capacitive load can be charged at a higher rate than what typical ICL would allow and FAULT will be masked to prevent unwanted Fault triggers. After ILIM_STARTUP_DELAY, the current limit will default back to ICL and Fault will work normally.
The initial inrush current period when the current limit is higher enables two different system advantages when driving loads:
* Enables higher load current to be supported for a period of time of the order of milliseconds to drive high inrush current loads like incandescent bulb loads.
* Enables fast capacitive load charging. In some situations, it is ideal to charge capacitive loads at a higher current than the DC current to ensure quick supply bring up. This architecture allows a module to quickly charge a capacitive load using the initial higher inrush current limit and then use a lower current limit to reliably protect the module under overload or short circuit conditions."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Short-Circuit and Overload Protection __ 3 Inductive-Load Switching-Off Clamp [desc]
When an inductive load is switching off, the output voltage is pulled down to negative, due to the inductance characteristics. The power FET may break down if the voltage is not clamped during the current-decay period. To protect the power FET in this situation, internally clamp the drain-to-source voltage, namely VDS,clamp, the clamp diode between the drain and gate.
VDS,Clamp = VS – VOUT (3)
During the current-decay period (TDECAY), the power FET is turned on for inductance-energy dissipation. Both the energy of the power supply (ES) and the load (ELOAD) are dissipated on the high-side power switch itself, which is called EHSD. If resistance is in series with inductance, some of the load energy is dissipated in the resistance.
EHSD = ES + ELOAD = ES + EL – ER (4)
From the high-side power switch’s view, EHSD equals
While in current limiting mode, at any level, the device will have a high power dissipation. If the FET temperature exceeds the over-temperature shutdown threshold, the device will turn off just the channel that is overloaded. After cooling down, the device will re-try. If the device is turning off prematurely on start-up, it is recommended to improve the PCB thermal layout, lower the current limit to lower power dissipation, or decrease the inrush current (capacitive loading).
For more information about capacitive charging with high side switches see the How to drive Capacitive loads application note. This application note has information about the thermal modeling available along with quick ways to estimate if a high side switch will be able to charge a capacitor to a given voltage."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Power FET Situation [desc]
The power FET in this situation, internally clamp the drain-to-source voltage, namely VDS,clamp, the clamp diode between the drain and gate. This can be represented by the formula:

"[desc] tps281c100 __ 1 Switch-Off Situation [desc]
As discussed previously, when switching off, battery energy and load energy are dissipated on the high-side power switch, which leads to the large thermal variation. For each high-side power switch, the upper limit of the maximum safe power dissipation depends on the device intrinsic capacity, ambient temperature, and board dissipation condition."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ 2 Inductive Load Demagnetization [desc]
When switching off an inductive load, the inductor can impose a negative voltage on the output of the switch. The TPS281C100 includes voltage clamps between VS and VOUT to limit the voltage across the FETs and demagnetize load inductance if there is any. The negative voltage applied at the OUT pin drives the discharge of inductor current. Further information about the maximum acceptable load inductance is provided in the following section."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ 3 Maximum Acceptable Load Inductance [desc]
The maximum acceptable load inductance is a function of the energy dissipated in the device and therefore the load current and the inductive load. The maximum energy and the load inductance the device can withstand for one pulse inductive dissipation at 125°C is shown in Figure 8-14. The device can withstand 40% of this energy for one million inductive repetitive pulses with a 2-Hz repetitive pulse. If the application parameters exceed this device limit, use a protection device like a freewheeling diode to dissipate the energy stored in the inductor."

"[desc] tps281c100 __ 5 Status Table __ 1 Open-Load Detection [desc]
On-State Open Load Detection
When the main channel is enabled faults are diagnosed by reading the voltage on the SNS or FLT pin and judged by the user. A benefit of high-accuracy current sense is that this device can achieve a very low open-load detection threshold, which correspondingly expands the normal operation region. As explained in section high accuracy sense mode, this mode can be used to sense low currents accurately.
Off-State Open Load Detection
In the off state, if a load is connected, the output voltage is pulled to 0V. In the case of an open load, the output voltage is close to the supply voltage, VS – VOUT < Vol,off. The FLT pin goes low to indicate the fault to the MCU, and the SNS pin is pulled up to ISNSFH. There is always a leakage current Iol,off present on the output, due to the internal logic control path or external humidity, corrosion, and so forth. Thus, TI implemented an internal pullup resistor to offset the leakage current. This pullup current should be less than the output load current to avoid false detection in the normal operation mode. To reduce the standby current, TI implemented a switch in series with the pullup resistor controlled by the DIAG_EN pin. The pull up resistor value is ROL_OFF."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ 5 Status Table __ 1 Open-Load Detection __ 2 Thermal Protection Behavior [desc]
The thermal protection behavior can be split up into 2 categories of events that can happen. Thermal behavior shows each of these categories.
1. Relative thermal shutdown: The device is enabled into an over current event. The DIAG_EN pin is high so that diagnostics can be monitored on SNS and FLT. The output current rises up to the IILIM level and the FLT goes low while the SNS goes to VSNSFH. With this large amount of current going through the junction temperature of the FET increases rapidly with respect to the controller temperature. When the power FET temperature rises TREL amount above the controller junction temperature ΔT = TFET – TCON > TREL, the device shuts down. The faults are continually shown on SNS and FLT and the part waits for the tRETRY timer to expire. When tRETRY timer expires, since EN is still high, the device will come back on into this IILIM condition.
2. Absolute thermal shutdown: In this case, the ambient temperature is now much higher than the previous case. The device is still enabled in an over current event with DIAG_EN high. However, in this case the junction temperature rises up and hits an absolute reference temperature, TABS, and then shuts down. The device will not recover until both TJ < TABS – Thys and the tRETRY timer has expired."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Thermal Behavior __ 3 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) Protection [desc]
The device monitors the supply voltage VS to prevent unpredicted behaviors in the event that the supply voltage is too low. When the supply voltage falls down to VUVLOF, the output stage is shut down automatically. When the supply rises up to VUVLOR, the device turns on. If an overcurrent event trips the UVLO threshold, the device will shut off and come back on into a current limit safely."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Thermal Behavior __ 3 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) Protection __ 4 Reverse Polarity Protection [desc]
Method 1: Blocking diode connected with VBB. Both the device and load are protected when in reverse polarity. The blocking diode does not allow any of the current to flow during reverse battery condition."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Reverse Protection With Blocking Diode [desc]
Method 2 (GND network protection): Only the high-side device is protected under this connection. The load reverse loop is limited by the load itself. Note when reverse polarity happens, the continuous reverse current through the power FET should be less than Irev. Of the three types of ground pin networks, TI strongly recommends type 3 (the resistor and diode in parallel). No matter what types of connection are between the device GND and the board GND, if a GND voltage shift happens, ensure the following proper connections for the normal operation:
- Leave the NC pin floating or connect to the device GND. TI recommends to leave floating.
- Connect the current limit programmable resistor to the device GND."

- VGNDshift is the maximum value for the GND shift, determined by the HSS and microcontroller. TI suggests a value ≤ 0.6 V.
- In# 8.5.5.4 Reverse Protection With GND Network
Type 1 (resistor): The higher resistor value contributes to a better current limit effect when the reverse battery or negative ISO pulses. However, it leads to higher GND shift during normal operation mode. Also, consider the resistor’s power dissipation.

"[desc] tps281c100 __ Reverse Protection With GND Network __ 5 Protection for MCU I/Os [desc]
In many conditions, such as the negative surge pulse, or the loss of battery with an inductive load, a negative potential on the device GND pin may damage the MCU I/O pins [more likely, the internal circuitry connected to the pins]. Therefore, the serial resistors between MCU and HSS are required.
Also, for proper protection against loss of GND, TI recommends 10 kΩ resistance for the RPROT resistors."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Reverse Protection With GND Network __ 5 Protection for MCU I/Os __ 6 Diagnostic Enable Function [desc]
The diagnostic enable pin, DIAG_EN, offers multiplexing of the microcontroller diagnostic input for current sense or digital status, by sharing the same sense resistor and ADC line or I/O port among multiple devices.
In addition, this pin can be used to manage power dissipation by the device. During the ouput-on period, if no continious sense output diagnositcs are required, the diagnostic disable feature will lower the operating current. On the other hand, the output-off period, the diagnostic disable function lowers the current consumption for the standby condition."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Reverse Protection With GND Network __ 5 Protection for MCU I/Os __ 7 Loss of Ground [desc]
The ground connection may be lost either on the device level or on the module level. If the ground connection is lost and the supply voltage is less than 48V, the channel output will be disabled irrespective of the EN input level. If the switch was already disabled when the ground connection was lost, the outputs will remain disabled even when the channels are enabled. The steady state current from the output to the load that remains connected to the system ground is below the level specified in the Specifications section of this document. When the ground is reconnected, normal operation will resume."

"[desc] tps281c100 __ Application and Implementation __ Typical Application __ IEC 61000-4-4 EFT [desc]
The TPS281C100 is designed to survive against IEC 61000-4-4 electrical fast transient (EFT) with minimum of 22 nF output capacitance. The device can pass ± 2 kV EFT at VS and VOUT ports. When EN is low, device will remain OFF during the EFT pulse, and functions normally after the pulse. When EN is high, the device will withstand the pulse and functions normally afterwards.
For active EFT detection during OFF state, TPS281C100 has the detection circuitry active when in the OFF state. It will introduce higher OFF state current IIDLE, VS or IIDLE, VS_DIAG compared to the usual shutdown current in other high-side switches.
In addition, when DIAG_EN is low, the device enables a current sink at the output that can sink up to IOUT (OFF, SINK) of current at the output. This is to help offset any leakage current from the device during the EFT, and keep the output voltage close to 0 V during the OFF state and EFT events. When DIAG_EN is high, there is OFF state pull-up resistance that pulls up the output voltage close to VS. In this case, the output current sink is not active."

To pass the IEC61000-4-5 surge for TPS281C100, both input an# 9.2.1.2 IEC 61000-4-5 Surge
To pass the IEC61000-4-5 surge for TPS281C100, both input and output TVS diodes are needed to help absorb the surge energy. There are certain requirements on the input and output TVS diodes selection listed below.
Output TVS requirements: Output TVS can serve two purposes: absorb the surge energy for the output surge, and help demagnetize the inductive energy during an inductive turn off. To ensure the output TVS clamps before the internal VDS clamp comes in during an output surge event, the clamping voltage the TVS needs to be selected so that VS + 
VTVS, CLMAP < VDS, Clamp, min. For standard 24V input system, SMBJ33CA is recommended at the output.
Input TVS requirements: Input TVS needs to be selected so it doesn't interfere with normal operation. The reverse standoff voltage of the input TVS needs to be greater than the normal operation input voltage. The other requirement is that the input TVS needs to be equal or higher voltage rated than the output TVS, and it ensures that the surge energy is clamped by the output TVS instead of the input TVS when there is a output surge. For standard 24V input system, SMBJ36A is recommended at the input. Please note that a uni-directional TVS at the input is needed so the absolute minimum voltage of the device is not violated for negative input surge."
"[desc] tps281c100 __ Application and Implementation __ 2 Detailed Design Procedure __ 1 Selecting RILIM [desc]
The current limit set level TPS281C100 must allow for the maximum DC current with margin but minimize the energy in the switch and the load on the input supply during a fault condition by minimizing the current limit.The nominal current limit should be set such that the worst case (lowest) current limit will be higher than the maximum nominal load current. If the application is a 500 mA digital output module, with the max current to be 1A, then there are two ways to set the current limit.First way is to use the resistor value listed in the electrical characteristic table. 25 kΩ RILIM resistor setting will set the current limit minimum level to be 1.5 A, which is above the maximum nominal load current. If the high end of the setting 2.3 A is acceptable in the application, then 25 kΩ RILIM resistance can be used.If the application wants to minimize the maximum current seen by the module as much as possible, then the current limit resistor needs to be chosen so that the minimum current limit level is as close to the maximum load current as possible. To obtain the minimum current limit to be 1 A, the typical current limit needed to be scaled for the same ratio 1 × 1.32 = 1.32 A. By linear interpolation, we can find the KCL value at 1.32 A typical current limit is 48.5 A * kΩ. RILIM = KCL / ICL (11) The calculated value of RILIM is 36.7 kΩ, and the closest 1% standard resistor value is 36.5 kΩ."

The load current measurement up to 3 A ensures that even in the event of a overload but below the set current limit, the MCU can register and react by turning off the FET while the low level of 4 mA allows for accurate measurement of low load currents and enable the distinction open load faults from supported nominal load currents. For load currents < 50 mA, the customer can enable high accuracy sensing to change the sense ratio from KSNS1 to KSNS2."

TJ must be less than 125°C. If the output current is very high, the power dissipation may be large. The HTSSOP and WSON packages have good thermal impedance. However, the PCB layout is very important. Good PCB design can optimize heat transfer, which is absolutely essential for the long-term reliability of the device. Maximize the copper coverage on the PCB to increase the thermal conductivity of the board. The major heat-flow path from the package to the ambient is through the copper on the PCB. Maximum copper is extremely important when there are not any heat sinks attached to the PCB on the other side of the board opposite the package. Add as many thermal vias as possible directly under the package ground pad to optimize the thermal conductivity of the board. All thermal vias should either be plated shut or plugged and capped on both sides of the board to prevent solder voids. To ensure reliability and performance, the solder coverage should be at least 85%."
