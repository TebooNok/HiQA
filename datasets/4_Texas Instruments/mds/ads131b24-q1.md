# 8 Parameter Measurement Information

# 8.1 Offset Drift Measurement
Offset drift is defined as the change in offset voltage over the specified temperature range. Offset drift is calculated using the box method in which a box is formed over the maximum and minimum offset voltages and over the specified temperature range. The box method specifies limits for the temperature error but does not specify the exact shape and slope of the device under test. For that reason, offset drift is specified as a positive number only, even though the drift can possibly be negative. 方程式 1 shows the offset drift calculation using the box method:
Offset Drift (nV/°C) = 109 × (VOFSMAX – VOFSMIN) / (TMAX – TMIN)
where:
• VOFSMIN and VOFSMAX = Minimum and maximum offset voltages over the specified temperature range
• TMIN and TMAX = Minimum and maximum temperatures

# 8.2 Gain Drift Measurement
Gain drift is defined as the change of gain error over the specified temperature range. Gain drift is calculated using the box method in which a box is formed over the maximum and minimum gain errors and over the specified temperature range. The box method specifies limits for the temperature error but does not specify the exact shape and slope of the device under test. For that reason, gain drift is specified as a positive number only, even though the drift can possibly be negative. 方程式 2 describes the gain drift calculation using the box method.
Gain Drift (ppm/°C) = (GEMAX – GEMIN) / (TMAX – TMIN)
where:
• GEMIN and GEMAX = Minimum and maximum gain errors over the specified temperature range
• TMIN and TMAX = Minimum and maximum temperatures

# 8.3 Noise Performance
Adjust the data rate and gain to optimize the noise performance of the individual ADCs. When reducing the data rate by increasing the oversampling ratio (OSR), averaging is increased and results in lower noise. 表 8-1 and 表 8-2 summarize the noise performance of ADC1y and ADC2y. The data are representative of typical noise performance at TA = 25°C using fMCLK = 8.192 MHz. The data shown are typical input-referred noise results in units of μVRMS with the analog inputs shorted together and averaging data across a 1-ms period. Use 方程式 3 to calculate effective resolution from the provided μVRMS numbers.
Effective Resolution = ln[(2 × VREFy / Gain) / VRMS-Noise] / ln(2)
The noise performance of ADC1y improves by a factor of √2 in global-chop mode.

# 9. Detailed Description

# 9.1. Overview
The ADS131B24-Q1 is a fully integrated, high-voltage battery pack monitor for automotive electrical vehicle 
(EV) battery management systems (BMS) that integrates two simultaneous-sampling, high-precision, 24-bit ADC 
channels (ADC1A, ADC1B) to redundantly measure battery current with high resolution and accuracy using 
an external shunt resistor. Two independent digital overcurrent detection comparators (OCCA, OCCB) work in 
parallel to the two ADCs for fast overcurrent detection.
Additionally, two multiplexed, 16-bit ADC channels (ADC2A, ADC2B) are available to measure shunt 
temperature using external temperature sensors, such as thermistors or analog output temperature sensors, 
and other voltages in the system. ADC2A and ADC2B are equipped with channel sequencers that automatically 
step through the configured multiplexer inputs, select them for measurement, and start ADC conversions.
The device is partitioned into two sections, A and B. The circuitry in section A is independent from the circuitry 
in section B. However, both sections are powered from the same supply, derive their respective clocks from the 
same main clock source, and share the same digital control and serial interface.
Besides the various ADC channels, each section provides a precision, low-drift, 1.25-V voltage reference (REFA, REFB) that feeds the ADCs in each section, a negative charge pump (NCPA, NCPB) that provides a negative supply voltage for the gain stages in front of each ADC to allow signal measurements below ground, a temperature sensor (TSA, TSB) to measure die temperature through ADC2A and ADC2B, respectively, a Test DAC (Test DAC A, Test DAC B), which generates precision test voltages that can be routed for measurement to the ADCs in the other section, and two GPIOs (GPIO0A, GPIO1A and GPIO0B, GPIO1B) with logic levels based on AVDD.
In many BMS applications, the pack monitor is powered from an unregulated isolated DC/DC converter. For that reason, the ADS131B24-Q1 integrates linear regulators (AVDD and IOVDD LDOs) that accept voltages between 4 V and 16 V and provide regulated 3.3-V analog and digital supply rails for the internal circuitry. The two low-dropout regulators (LDOs) can also provide a limited amount of current to external circuitry. A common use case is to power the primary side of a digital isolator, which isolates the SPI communication to a host microcontroller, with the IOVDD LDO output; see the ADS131B26Q1EVM-PDK Evaluation Module user guide.
The main clock for the ADS131B24-Q1 is either provided by the internal 8.192-MHz oscillator or by an external clock provided at the CLK pin.
A multitude of monitoring and diagnostic features are integrated in the device to mitigate and detect random hardware faults to aid in the development of functional safety BMS, such as supply undervoltage, overvoltage, overtemperature, and oscillation monitors, supply-voltage readback capability through ADC2A and ADC2B, a set of open-wire detection current sources and sinks per ADC, clock monitors, cyclic redundancy check (CRC), timeout monitor, and SCLK counter on the SPI to achieve high data integrity for the communication, register and memory map CRC, and ADC.# 1.

The ADS131B24-Q1 integrates two precision, low-drift, band-gap voltage references (REFA and REFB), one for each section of the device. The references have a nominal voltage of 1.25 V. No external voltage reference can be provided to the device. All ADCs in section A use REFA and, correspondingly, all ADCs in section B use REFB. The RCAPA and RCAPB pins are outputs of the voltage references. Decouple the RCAPA pin with a 1-μF capacitor to AGNDA and the RCAPB pin with a 1-μF capacitor to AGNDB. The voltage references are buffered and can source external circuitry with a limited amount of current out of the RCAPy pins. The buffers cannot sink any current. See the Electrical Characteristics table for details.

# 9.3.3 Clocking (MCLK, OSCM, OSCD)
The ADS131B24-Q1 requires a main clock (MCLK) to operate. As shown in 图 9-1, the main clock to the ADS131B24-Q1 is provided in one of two ways:
- By the internal 8.192-MHz main oscillator (OSCM) or
- By an external clock on the CLK pin
The CLK_SOURCE bit selects the according main clock source for the device. At device power-up or after device reset, the internal main oscillator is selected as the MCLK source by default. The modulator clock of the various delta-sigma ADCs is derived from the common main clock. A clock divider divides the main clock frequency (fMCLK) by a factor of two to create the modulator frequency (fMOD = fMCLK / 2) with a duty cycle of 50%.

# 9.3.4 ADC1y
The primary purpose of the 24-bit ADC1A and ADC1B is to redundantly measure battery current across an external low-side, GND-referenced shunt resistor. The ADC1y channel signal chain consists of two differential analog inputs (CPy, CNy), an input multiplexer followed by a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), a delta-sigma modulator and digital filter, and the global-chop and calibration logic.

# 9.3.4.4 ADC1y Digital Filter

# 9.3.4.5 ADC1y Offset and Gain Calibration
ADC1y provides the ability to compute offset and gain corrected conversion data using user-programmable offset and gain correction registers. As shown in Figure 9-5, the 24-bit offset correction value (OCAL1y[23:0]) is subtracted from the conversion data before being multiplied by the 16-bit gain correction factor (GCAL1y[15:0]). Output data are rounded to the final resolution and clipped to +FS and –FS code values after the scaling operation. The offset and gain calibration coefficients must be stored in external nonvolatile memory and programmed into the offset and gain calibration registers each time the device powers up or resets because the ADS131B24-Q1 registers are volatile.

# 9.3.4.6 Offset Calibration Value Examples
The 24 bit offset calibration value is provided in two's complement format and programmed into the OCAL1y[23:0] bit field that spans across the ADC1y_OCAL_MSB and ADC1y_OCAL_LSB registers. Table 9-5 shows example offset calibration values. The LSB size of the offset calibration value is calculated using Equation 6. LSB size = (2 × VREFy) / (GAIN1y × 224)

# 9.3.4.7 Gain Calibration Value Examples
The 16-bit gain calibration value is provided in two's-complement format and programmed into the GCAL1y[15:0] bit field. One LSB of the gain calibration value equals a gain correction factor of 1/216 = 0.000015. Table 9-6 shows example gain calibration values.
---table begin---

| GCAL1y[15:0] VALUE | APPLIED GAIN CORRECTION |
|---|---|
| 7FFFh | 1.499985 |

| 0000h | 1 |
| FFFFh | 0.999985 |
| 8000h | 0.5 |
---table end---
The recommended calibration procedure is as follows:
1.
Preset the offset and gain calibration registers to OCAL1y[23:0] = 000000h and GCAL1y[15:0] = 0000h, respectively.
2.
Perform an offset calibration by shorting the ADC1y inputs internally using the respective input multiplexer setting (MUX1y[1:0] = 10b), or short the inputs externally at the system level to include the offset error of the external filter stages. Acquire multiple conversion data and write the average value of the data into the offset calibration registers. Averaging the data reduces conversion noise to improve cal# 0.5. The recommended calibration procedure is as follows:
1. Preset the offset and gain calibration registers to OCAL1y[23:0] = 000000h and GCAL1y[15:0] = 0000h, respectively.
2. Perform an offset calibration by shorting the ADC1y inputs internally using the respective input multiplexer setting (MUX1y[1:0] = 10b), or short the inputs externally at the system level to include the offset error of the external filter stages. Acquire multiple conversion data and write the average value of the data into the offset calibration registers. Averaging the data reduces conversion noise to improve calibration accuracy.
3. Perform a gain calibration by applying a precision calibration signal to the ADC1y inputs or at the system level to include the gain error of the external filter stages. Choose the calibration voltage to be less than the full-scale input range to avoid clipping the output code. Clipped output codes result in inaccurate calibration. For example, use a 150-mV calibration signal when using gain = 8. Acquire multiple conversion data and average the results. Use Equation 7 to calculate the gain calibration value.
    Gain Calibration Value = (expected output code / actual output code)
    (7)
The expected output code for a 150-mV calibration voltage using gain = 8 is: (150 mV / LSB size) = 7AE148h, where LSB size = (2 × 1.25 V) / (8 × 224). If the actual measured output code is 6FB587h for example, then the gain calibration factor calculates to 1.1. The resulting gain calibration value to write into the GCAL1y[15:0] bit field is: (1.1 – 1) / (1 / 216) = 199Ah.

# 9.3.4.6 ADC1y Conversion Data
Conversion data for ADC1A and ADC1B are 24 bits and are automatically output on SDO as part of the SPI frame, unless register data are output following a register read command.
Data are provided in binary two's-complement format. 
Use Equation 8 to calculate the size of one code (LSB).
1 LSB = (2 × VREFy / Gain) / 224 = +FSR / 223
(8)
A positive full-scale input VIN ≥ +FSR – 1 LSB = VREFy / Gain – 1 LSB produces an output code of 7FFFFFh and a negative full-scale input (VIN ≤ –FSR = –VREFy / Gain) produces an output code of 800000h. The output clips at these codes for signals that exceed full-scale.

# 9.3.5 ADC2y
The purpose of the multiplexed, 16-bit ADC2A and ADC2B is to measure shunt temperature using external thermistors or analog output temperature sensors, and any other voltages that must be measured in the BMS.
The ADC2y channel signal chain consists of eight analog inputs (V0y to V7y), an input multiplexer followed by a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), a delta-sigma modulator and digital filter, calibration logic, and a channel sequencer.

# 9.3.5.1 ADC2y Input Multiplexer
The input multiplexer controls which signals are routed to the positive and negative PGA inputs of the ADC2y channel in each sequence step. Configure the input multiplexer using the SEQ2y_STEPn_CH_P[3:0] and SEQ2y_STEPn_CH_N bits.
The input multiplexer allows the following inputs to be connected to the PGA:
• Any of the eight analog inputs# 9.3.5.1 ADC2y Input Multiplexer
The input multiplexer controls which signals are routed to the positive and negative PGA inputs of the ADC2y channel in each sequence step. Configure the input multiplexer using the SEQ2y_STEPn_CH_P[3:0] and SEQ2y_STEPn_CH_N bits.
The input multiplexer allows the following inputs to be connected to the PGA:
- Any of the eight analog inputs, V0y to V7y, in single-ended measurement configuration when AGNDy is selected as the negative multiplexer channel.
- Any of the seven analog inputs, V0y to V6y, in single-ended measurement configuration when V7y is selected as the negative multiplexer channel and connected to AGNDy externally.
- Any of the seven analog inputs, V0y to V6y, in pseudo-differential measurement configuration when V7y is selected as the negative multiplexer channel. Connect a positive bias voltage to V7y in this case, either using an external bias voltage or the internal common-mode voltage of the VCMy buffer.
- Internal temperature sensor, TSy.
- Internal short to AGNDy. Use this setting for self-offset calibration of the ADC2y channel.
- DC test signal provided by the Test DAC of the other section.
- Attenuated signals of the various supply voltages (APWR, DPWR, AVDD, IOVDD, and DVDD).
Whenever a signal other than an analog input is selected as the positive multiplexer input, the analog inputs are disconnected from the PGA and AGNDy is selected automatically as the negative multiplexer input.

# 9.3.5.2 ADC2y Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA)
ADC2y features an integrated programmable gain amplifier (PGA) that provides gains of 1, 2, and 4. Select the gain setting using the SEQ2y_STEPn_GAIN[1:0] bits. Varying the PGA gain scales the differential full-scale input voltage range (FSR) of ADC2y.
FSR = ±1.25 V / Gain

| Gain Setting | FSR        |

---table end---
When performing single-ended measurements (that is, AGNDy is selected as the negative multiplexer channel for ADC2y), gain settings of 1 and 2 only allow for unipolar measurements, whereas gain setting of 4 allows for both unipolar and bipolar input voltage measurements. See the absolute input voltage range specification of ADC2y in the Recommended Operating Conditions table for details and the ADC2y Measurement Configurations section for example input configurations. Unipolar measurements only use the positive code range from approximately 0000h to 7FFFh, which maps to an input voltage range from approximately 0 V to +FS. 
The input impedance of the ADC2y channel depends on two factors: the main clock frequency (fMCLK) and the selected OSR setting. The Electrical Characteristics table lists typical input impedance values for# 9.3.5.1 Input Voltage Measurements
lar input voltage measurements. See the absolute input voltage range specification of ADC2y in the Recommended Operating Conditions table for details and the ADC2y Measurement Configurations section for example input configurations. Unipolar measurements only use the positive code range from approximately 0000h to 7FFFh, which maps to an input voltage range from approximately 0 V to +FS.

# 9.3.5.2 ADC2y Input Impedance
The input impedance of the ADC2y channel depends on two factors: the main clock frequency (fMCLK) and the selected OSR setting. The Electrical Characteristics table lists typical input impedance values for fMCLK = 
8.192 MHz at the various OSR settings. Increasing the OSR by twice the value effectively doubles the input impedance. The input impedance scales indirectly proportional with the MCLK frequency.

# 9.3.5.3 ADC2y ΔΣ Modulator
ADC2y uses a second-order, delta-sigma (ΔΣ) modulator to convert the analog input signal to a 1's density modulated digital bitstream. The ΔΣ modulator oversamples the input signal at a frequency many times greater than the output data rate. The modulator frequency, fMOD, of ADC2y is equal to half the main clock frequency (that is, fMOD = fMCLK / 2).

# 9.3.5.4 ADC2y Digital Filter
The ADC2y ΔΣ modulator bitstream feeds into a digital filter. The digital filter is a linear phase, finite impulse response (FIR), low-pass sinc filter that attenuates the out-of-band quantization noise of the ΔΣ modulator.

# 9.3.5.5 ADC2y Conversion Mode
In contrast to ADC1y, ADC2y always operates in a single-shot conversion mode fashion. The ADC2y sequencer triggers the individual conversions. The digital filter resets at the start of every conversion and must completely settle for every conversion. ADC2y only outputs settled conversion results, assuming that the input signal settled before the conversion started.

# 9.3.5.6 ADC2y Conversion Time 
Use the OSR2y[1:0] bits to select the conversion time for ADC2y. For an OSR = 64, the filter is comprised of a pure sinc3 filter. A sinc3 filter takes three cycles to settle. Therefore, the conversion time for an OSR = 64 equals (3 × 64 / fMOD = 192 tMOD = 384 tMCLK). For higher OSR settings the sinc3 filter is followed by a sinc1 filter.

# 9.3.5.8 ADC2y Offset and Gain Calibration
ADC2y provides the ability to compute offset and gain corrected conversion data using user-programmable offset and gain correction registers. The same calibration values are used for all sequence steps, however, the offset and gain correction factors are not applied when the internal temperature sensor is selected for measurement by MUX2y. As shown in 图 9-8, the 16-bit offset correction value (OCAL2y[15:0]) is subtracted from the conversion data before being multiplied by the 16-bit gain correction factor (GCAL2y15:0]). Output data are rounded to the final resolution and clipped to +FS and –FS code values after the scaling operation. The offset and gain calibration coefficients must be stored in external nonvolatile memory and programmed into the offset and gain calibration registers each time the device powers up or resets because the ADS131B24-Q1 registers are volatile.

When the VCMy buffer is enabled, the capacitive load from V7y to AGNDy must be limited to less than 100 pF.

The ADS131B24-Q1 offers five GPIO pins (GPIO0 to GPIO4) that use logic levels based on the IOVDD supply. See the Electrical Characteristics table for details regarding the logic high and low levels. The GPIOs offer a multitude of configuration options:
- Configure the individual GPIOs as either digital inputs or digital outputs using the respective GPIOx_DIR bits (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Configure the input and output format of the individual GPIOs as either static logic levels or PWM using the respective GPIOx_FMT bits. See the GPIOx PWM Output Configuration section for details on how to configure the PWM period and duty cycle for a specific GPIO.
- Four of the GPIO pins can be configured with a special output function (FAULT, MHD, OCCA, and OCCB) using the respective GPIOx_SRC bits. Configure GPIOx as a digital output using the GPIOx_DIR bit when selecting the special output function for GPIOx.
Use the GPOx_DAT bit to drive a logic high or low level on the respective GPIO pin when GPIOx is configured as a digital output. The GPIO outputs are push-pull. GPIOx ignores the value written to the GPOx_DAT bit when configured for a special output function.
The device always reads back the value of the GPIOs and provides the detected logic level in the GPIx_DAT[1:0] bit fields, no matter if GPIOx is configured as digital input or output. See the GPIx_DAT[1:0] bit field descriptions for details on how the device decodes PWM signals.
The GPIOs are configured as inputs when the device is held in reset.

# 9.3.6.1 GPIOx PWM Output Configuration
When GPIOx is configured for PWM format using the GPIOx_FMT bit, the PWM period and duty cycle can be independently configured for a logic high and low level with fine granularity. The GPIOx_LL_PWM_LC[6:0] (GPIOx logic low level PWM low counter value) and GPIOx_LL_PWM_HC[6:0] (GPIOx logic low level PWM high counter value) bits together with the GPIOx_PWM_TB[1:0] (GPIOx PWM time base) bits determine the PWM period and duty cycle when a logic low level is driven as per the GPOx_DAT bit. Similarly, the GPIOx_LH_PWM_LC[6:0] (GPIOx logic high level PWM low counter value) and GPIOx_LH_PWM_HC[6:0] (GPIOx logic high level PWM high counter value) bits together with the GPIOx_PWM_TB[1:0] bits determine the PWM period and duty cycle when a logic high level is driven as per the GPOx_DAT bit.
The following equations specify the PWM period and duty cycle:
- PWM period = (PWM high counter value + PWM low counter value) × PWM time base (14)
- PWM low time = (PWM low counter value × PWM time base) (15)
- PWM high time = (PWM high counter value × PWM time base) (16)
- PWM duty cycle = PWM high time / (PWM high time + PWM low time) (17)
The PWM period always starts with the PWM low time. Changes to the PWM period and duty cycle based on the GPOx_DAT bit only take effect at the start of a new PWM period.

# 9.3.6.2 GPIOx PWM Input Readback
For GPIOx to decode PWM input signals, configure the GPIOx_FMT bit for PWM decoding. GPIOx uses the time base configured in the GPIOx_PWM_TB[1:0] bits for PWM decoding. The decoded input value is provided in the GPIx_DAT[1:0] bit field. The GPIOs decode PWM signals with four different levels as specified in the GPI_DAT[1:0] bit field description. The GPIx_DAT[1:0] bits need up to two PWM cycles to indicate the correct logic level after the PWM period or duty cycle applied to GPIOx changed.

# 9.3.7 General-Purpose Digital Inputs and Outputs (GPIO0A, GPIO1A, GPIO0B, GPIO1B)
The ADS131B24-Q1 offers four additional GPIO pins (GPIO0A, GPIO1A, GPIO0B, and GPIO1B) that use logic levels based on the AVDD supply. See the Electrical Characteristics table for details regarding the logic high and low levels. The GPIOs offer a multitude of configuration options: Configure the individual GPIOs as either digital inputs or digital outputs using the respective GPIOxy_DIR bits (x = 0 or 1, y = A or B). Configure the input format of the individual GPIOs for either static logic level or PWM inputs using the respective GPIOxy_FMT bits. In contrast to GPIO0 to GPIO4, the GPIOxy do not offer PWM output capability. Select the appropriate PWM timebase for each GPIO PWM decoder using the GPIOxy_PWM_TB[1:0] bits. The timebase of the source driving the GPIOxy input must be equal to or slower than the timebase of the GPIOxy input decoder, otherwise the logic levels are not correctly decoded. GPIOxy always uses static logic levels when configured as a digital output. Use the GPOxy_DAT bit to drive a logic high or low level on the respective GPIO pin when GPIOxy is configured as a digital output. The GPIO outputs are push-pull. The device always reads back the value of the GPIOs and provides the detected logic level in the GPIxy_DAT[1:0] bit fields, regardless if GPIOxy is configured as a digital input or output. See the GPIxy_DAT[1:0] bit field descriptions for details on how the device decodes PWM signals.

Besides the monitors, indicators, and counters mentioned in the previous tables, the ADS131B24-Q1 offers additional means to check the integrity of the device, such as: Power-supply voltage readback using ADC2A or ADC2B, Two temperature sensors, TSA and TSB, Two test DACs, TDACA and TDACB, Open-wire detection current sources and sinks on every ADC.

# 9.3.8.1 Supply Monitors
Individual power-on reset (POR) circuits are implemented on the AVDD, IOVDD, and DVDD supplies. If any of the three supplies drop below the respective POR threshold, the device is held in reset.
The ADS131B24-Q1 monitors the outputs of the three internal LDOs (AVDD, IOVDD, and DVDD) for overvoltage (OV), undervoltage (UV), and oscillations. See the Electrical Characteristics table for the according monitor detection thresholds. If an OV event occurs, the respective LDO shuts down to prevent damage to the internal circuitry. The LDO turns back on after the output voltage drops below the OV threshold. The device can potentially reset if the supply.# 9.3.8 Power-Supply Monitors
The ADS131B24-Q1 supports a power-on-reset (POR) detector that is triggered based on the AVDD, IOVDD, and DVDD supplies. If any of the three supplies drop below the respective POR threshold, the device is held in reset.
The ADS131B24-Q1 monitors the outputs of the three internal LDOs (AVDD, IOVDD, and DVDD) for overvoltage (OV), undervoltage (UV), and oscillations. See the Electrical Characteristics table for the according monitor detection thresholds. If an OV event occurs, the respective LDO shuts down to prevent damage to the internal circuitry. The LDO turns back on after the output voltage drops below the OV threshold. The device can potentially reset if the supply voltage drops below the POR threshold before the LDO is turned on again. The LDOs do not shut down when an OV diagnostic is performed.

# 9.3.8.1 Bypassing the Internal LDOs 
AVDD or IOVDD can be supplied externally when shorting APWR to AVDD or DPWR to IOVDD, respectively, thus bypassing the internal LDOs. The monitors check the externally provided supply when bypassing the internal LDO. Configure the IOVDD OV and UV monitor thresholds using the IOVDD_OV_TH and IOVDD_UV_TH bits based on the used IOVDD supply.

# 9.3.8.1.1 Overtemperature Events
The AVDD and IOVDD LDOs integrate individual temperature sensors to indicate potential overtemperature events. Configure the overtemperature warning thresholds using the AVDD_OTW_CFG[1:0] and IOVDD_OTW_CFG[1:0] bits.

# 9.3.8.1.2 Output Current Limit
The AVDD and IOVDD LDOs are designed with an output current limit to prevent excessive current draw from the LDOs. When the LDOs operate in current limit, the according fault flags are set. If more current draw is demanded from the LDOs than the current limit, then the LDO output voltage typically drops below the POR threshold and causes a POR event.

# 9.3.8.2 Clock Monitors
The ADS131B24-Q1 integrates a diagnostic oscillator (OSCD) to monitor the frequency of the selected main clock (MCLK), which is either sourced from the internal main oscillator (OSCM) or from an external clock provided at the CLK pin. The MCLK_FAULTn flag is set to 0b when the frequencies between the main clock and the diagnostic oscillator deviate by more than the main clock fault detection frequency threshold (MCLK_FAULT_TH).

# 9.3.8.2.1 Watchdogs
Additionally, individual watchdogs (MCLK_WD and OSCD_WD) monitor the main clock and the diagnostic oscillator to detect a missing clock signal. The MCLK_WDn flag is set to 0b when the MCLK frequency drops below fMCLK_WD_TH, and the OSCD_WDn flag is set to 0b when the OSCD frequency drops below fOSCD_WD_TH.

# 9.3.8.3 Digital Monitors
The following sections explain the available digital monitors, such as register map CRC, memory map CRC, and GPIO readback functionality.

# 9.3.8.3.1 Register Map CRC
Register map CRCs in the ADS131B24-Q1 detect unintended changes in the register map contents. The register map is divided into four sections.
Section 0 includes read-only bits that update the values based on the device state or ADC2y conversion data. Therefore, section 0 does not offer any register map CRC check.

# 9.3.8.3.1.1 Sections 1 to 3
Sections 1 to 3 include the device configuration bits and provide independent CRC checks. Enable the register map CRC for each section using the REG_MAPx_CRC_EN (x = 1 to 3) bits. When the register map CRC for a section is enabled, the device constantly calculates a 16-bit CRC value across that register map section and compares the internal calculation result against the CRC value provided by the user in the REG_MAPx_CRC_VALUE[15:0] bit field. If the internal calculation result a# 1. Device State and ADC2y Conversion Data
On the device state or ADC2y conversion data. Therefore, section 0 does not offer any register map CRC check.

# 2. Sections 1 to 3
Sections 1 to 3 include the device configuration bits and provide independent CRC checks. Enable the register map CRC for each section using the REG_MAPx_CRC_EN (x = 1 to 3) bits. When the register map CRC for a section is enabled, the device constantly calculates a 16-bit CRC value across that register map section and compares the internal calculation result against the CRC value provided by the user in the REG_MAPx_CRC_VALUE[15:0] bit field. If the internal calculation result and the REG_MAPx_CRC_VALUE[15:0] do not match, the REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn is set to 0b. No other action is taken by the device in the event of a register map section CRC fault.
The CRC calculation begins with the MSB of the first register in the respective register section and ends with the LSB of the last specified register in the respective register section using the polynomial selected in the CRC_TYPE bit.

# 3. Register Map CRC

Table title: Registers Covered by Register Map CRC

|---|---|
| 0 | N/A |
| 1 | 40h to 59h |
| 2 | 80h to A3h |
| 3 | C0h to E3h |
---table end---
The CRC calculation is implemented serially, one register map bit per OSCD period. Therefore, unintended bit changes are not indicated immediately in the REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn fault flags, but can take up to tp(REG_MAP_CRC).

# 4. Procedure to Change Register Bits in Sections 1 to 3
Use the following procedure to change register bits in sections 1 to 3 without accidentally causing a REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn indication:
- Disable the register map section x CRC by setting REG_MAPx_CRC_EN = 0b
- Wait the fault response time tp(REG_MAP_CRC)
- If the REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn fault flag is set to 0b, clear the fault flag by writing 1b to the REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn bit
- Optional: Verify the REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn fault flag is cleared to 1b
- Optional: Clear the DIGITAL_FAULTn fault flag by writing 1b to the DIGITAL_FAULTn bit
- Change the section x register bits as needed
- Update the REG_MAPx_CRC_VALUE[15:0] bits based on the new register map section x settings
- Enable the register map section x CRC by setting REG_MAPx_CRC_EN = 1b
Register bits in section x can also be changed while the register map section x CRC is enabled, as discussed in the following procedure, but can cause unintended REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn indications.
- Change the section x register bits as needed while the register map section x CRC is enabled
- Update the REG_MAPx_CRC_VALUE[15:0] bits based on the new register map section x settings
- Wait the fault response time tp(REG_MAP_CRC)
- If the the REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn fault flag is set to 0b, clear the fault flag by writing 1b to the REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn bit
- Optional: Verify the REG_MAPx_CRC_FAULTn fault flag is cleared to 1b
- Optional: Clear the DIGITAL_FAULTn fault flag by writing 1b to the DIGITAL_FAULTn bit

# 5. Memory Map CRC
Similar to the register map CRC, the device uses a memory map CRC to check the internal memory for random bit changes. Changes to the internal memory bits can cause undetermined device behavior or degraded device performance. The memory map CRC is always enabled and constantly calculates the CRC value across the internal memory map. The device compares the calculation result against a memory.# 9.3.8.3.2 Memory Map CRC
Similar to the register map CRC, the device uses a memory map CRC to check the internal memory for random bit changes. Changes to the internal memory bits can cause undetermined device behavior or degraded device performance. The memory map CRC is always enabled and constantly calculates the CRC value across the internal memory map. The device compares the calculation result against a memory map CRC value that is stored in the memory map in production. If the internal calculation result and the stored memory map CRC value do not match, the MEM_MAP_CRC_FAULTn is set to 0b. No other action is taken by the device in the event of a memory map CRC fault. The CRC calculation is implemented serially, one memory map word per OSCD period. Therefore random bit changes are not indicated immediately in the MEM_MAP_CRC_FAULTn fault flag, but can take up to tp(MEM_MAP_CRC). In case of a memory map CRC fault, write 1b to the MEM_MAP_CRC_FAULTn bit to clear the fault flag to 1b. Reset the device if the fault flag continues to set to 0b.

# 9.3.8.3.3 GPIO Readback
All available GPIOs (GPIOx, GPIOxy) in ADS131B24-Q1 provide an independent readback path when the respective GPIO is configured as digital output. That means an input receiver circuit independent from the output driver circuit detects the voltage level driven on the GPIO pin. The result of the readback is displayed in the according GPIx_DAT[1:0] and GPIxy_DAT[1:0] bit fields.

# 9.3.8.4 Communication Monitors
The communication related monitors (SPI CRC, SPI timeout, and SCLK counter) are explained in detail in the Serial Interface Communication Structure section. In addition, the register access monitor indicates if a read or write register access was attempted to register addresses FFh or beyond. Writing to or reading from not specified register addresses within the address range from 00h to FEh does not trigger a fault indication. The data and register address returned when reading from a non-existing register is all 0s.

# 9.3.8.5 Fault Flags and Fault Masking
To clear a set combined fault flag to 1b, the host must first clear all set fault flags in the corresponding detailed status register. Only after all fault flags in the detailed status register are cleared to 1.# 1. Detailed Status Register
The fault flags in the detailed status register set to 0b, then the combined fault flag sets to 0b as well.

# 9.3.8.5 Fault Flags and Fault Masking
To clear a set combined fault flag to 1b, the host must first clear all set fault flags in the corresponding detailed status register. Only after all fault flags in the detailed status register are cleared to 1b can the host clear the combined fault flag by writing 1b.

# 2. ADS131B24-Q1 Additional Masking
The ADS131B24-Q1 allows additional masking of individual fault flags located in the detailed status registers from triggering the combined fault flag in the STATUS_MSB register. The masking bits are located in the SUPPLY_FAULT_MASK, CLOCK_FAULT_MASK, and DIGITAL_FAULT_MASK registers. If a fault flag in a detailed status register is masked, a fault indicated by this masked fault flag does not trigger a fault indication of the combined fault flag in the STATUS_MSB register. However, the fault is still indicated by the fault flag in the detailed status register.

# 3. AVDD OV Monitor Examples 
The following examples for the AVDD OV monitor explain the various configuration options:
No AVDD OV fault indication required in either SUPPLY_STATUS (AVDD_OVn fault flag) or STATUS_MSB (SUPPLY_FAULTn fault flag) register: Disable the AVDD OV monitor by setting AVDD_OV_EN = 0b.
AVDD OV fault indication in SUPPLY_STATUS, but not in STATUS_MSB register: Enable the AVDD OV monitor by setting AVDD_OV_EN = 1b. Mask the AVDD_OVn fault flag from triggering the SUPPLY_FAULTn fault flag by setting AVDD_OV_MASK = 1b.
AVDD OV fault indication in both SUPPLY_STATUS and STATUS_MSB register: Enable the AVDD OV monitor by setting AVDD_OV_EN = 1b. Unmask the AVDD_OVn fault flag by setting AVDD_OV_MASK = 0b.

# 4. FAULT Pin
The GPIO2/FAULT pin can be configured as a FAULT indication output by setting GPIO2_DIR = 1b and GPIO2_SRC = 0b. The FAULT pin is active when any of the STATUS_MSB[14:7] fault flags set to 0b. The FAULT pin changes to inactive as soon as all STATUS_MSB[14:7] fault flags are cleared to 1b. The actual output signal of the FAULT pin when active or inactive depends on the GPIO2 format (GPIO2_FMT bit) and FAULT pin polarity (FAULT_POL bit) configuration. See the respective bit descriptions and the General-Purpose Digital Inputs and Outputs (GPIO0 to GPIO4) section for details.

Additionally, the ADS131B24-Q1 allows masking of any of the eight STATUS_MSB[14:7] fault flags from triggering the FAULT pin. Use the mask bits in the FAULT_PIN_MASK register to mask individual fault flags. If a fault flag is masked and the respective fault flag is set to 0b in the STATUS_MSB register, then no fault is indicated.# n Example

# 9.3.8.7 Diagnostics and Diagnostic Procedure
Diagnostics detect faults within a monitoring circuit to check if the monitor is still working as intended. Enable a diagnostic using the respective enable bit in 表 9-15 to inject a fault condition into the monitoring circuit. When the according monitor fault flag sets to 0b within the specified monitor fault response time (see the Electrical Characteristics table), the diagnostic completed successfully, indicating a correctly working monitor.
Except for the main clock frequency monitor diagnostics (MCLK_HI_DIAG_EN and MCLK_LO_DIAG_EN), all diagnostics can be performed simultaneously to save execution time. The MCLK_HI_DIAG_EN and MCLK_LO_DIAG_EN diagnostics must be performed sequentially. However, either the MCLK_HI_DIAG_EN or the MCLK_LO_DIAG_EN can be executed together with all other diagnostics.
The following steps outline the general procedure for implementing a monitor diagnostic. An example for implementing the AVDD UV monitor diagnostic is shown in parentheses.
* Enable monitor (set AVDD_UV_EN = 1b)
* Wait the fault response time (wait tp(AVDD_UV))
* Clear the detailed fault flag (write 1b to AVDD_UVn)
* Optional: Verify that the detailed fault flag is cleared to 1b (read AVDD_UVn)
* Optional: Clear the main fault flag (write 1b to SUPPLY_FAULTn)
* Enable diagnostic (set AVDD_UV_DIAG_EN = 1b)
* Wait the fault response time (wait tp(AVDD_UV))
* Check if the detailed fault flag is set to 0b (read AVDD_UVn)
* Disable monitor (set AVDD_UV_EN = 0b)
* Disable diagnostic (set AVDD_UV_DIAG_EN = 0b)
* Clear the detailed fault flag (write 1b to AVDD_UVn)
* Optional: Clear the main fault flag (write 1b to SUPPLY_FAULTn)
* Enable monitor (set AVDD_UV_EN = 1b)
The memory map CRC diagnostic is a small exception. Instead of an enable bit, select any of the three bit patterns available in the MEM_MAP_CRC_DIAG[1:0] bit field to inject into the memory map CRC calculation.

# 9.3.8.8 Indicators
The ADS131B24-Q1 provides a set of indicator bits inside the STATUS_MSB and STATUS_LSB registers that help to verify the state of the device:
* Command response: The COMMAND_RESPONSE[3:0] bit field is transmitted in every SPI frame and provides feedback about the command that was received by the device in the previous frame. Information about which command was executed is also provided. See the COMMAND_RESPONSE[3:0] register bit field description for details.
* Lock state: The LOCK bit indicates if the device is currently locked or unlocked. See the Commands section for details on how to lock and unlock the device.
* Clock source: The CLOCK bit indicates which clock source the device is using as the main clock, either the internal main oscillator (OSCM) or an external clock provided at the CLK pin.
* Operating mode: The MODE bit indicates which mode the device is currently operating in, either active, standby, or power-down mode.
* ADC2A sequence active: The SEQ2A_ACTIVE bit indicates i# 9.3.8.9 Conversion and Sequence Counters
The STATUS_LSB register includes 2-bit conversion and sequence counters for the various ADCs 
(CONV1y_COUNT[1:0], SEQ2y_COUNT[1:0]).
The conversion counter, CONV1y_COUNT[1:0], increments every time a new conversion on ADC1y completes. 
The counter rolls over from 11b to 00b. To reset the counter, disable ADC1y or place the device in standby or 
power-down mode. The device makes sure that the conversion counter value always matches to the ADC1y 
conversion result that is output in the same SPI frame.
The sequence counter, SEQ2y_COUNT[1:0], increments every time a new sequence on ADC2y completes. 
The counter rolls over from 11b to 00b. To reset the counter, disable ADC2y or place the device in standby 
or power-down mode. The device makes sure that the sequence counter value always matches to the ADC2y 
conversion step results that are output in the same SPI frame. That means, if a new sequence completes while 
reading out conversion results from the ADC2y conversion step result registers (SEQxy_STEPx_DATA), the 
conversion results from the new sequence run are blocked from overwriting the conversion result registers, but 
are internally buffered. Only after the read command is complete do the buffered conversion results from the 
new sequence run update the conversion step result registers.

# 9.3.8.10 Supply Voltage Readback
In addition to the dedicated supply monitors, all supplies (APWR, DPWR, AVDD, IOVDD, and DVDD) can 
also be measured back internally through ADC2A or ADC2B. Resistor dividers are integrated in the device 
to attenuate the supply voltages to within the input voltage range of ADC2A and ADC2B. See the Electrical 
Characteristics table for the according attenuation factors. Use the SEQ2y_STEPx_CH_P[3:0] bits to configure 
an ADC2y sequence step for any of the supply voltage measurements.# 9.3.8.10 Supply Voltage Readback
In addition to the dedicated supply monitors, all supplies (APWR, DPWR, AVDD, IOVDD, and DVDD) can 
also be measured back internally through ADC2A or ADC2B. Resistor dividers are integrated in the device 
to attenuate the supply voltages to within the input voltage range of ADC2A and ADC2B. See the Electrical 
Characteristics table for the according attenuation factors. Use the SEQ2y_STEPx_CH_P[3:0] bits to configure 
an ADC2y sequence step for any of the supply voltage measurements.
The supply voltage measurement accuracy depends on two factors:
* Multiplexer delay time (configured using the MUX2y_DELAY[2:0] bits)
* ADC2y conversion time (configured using the OSR2y[1:0] bits)
The large resistor divider values used internally to divide the supply voltages down together with the internal 
filter capacitor lead to a large RC filter time constant. The input signal therefore needs considerable time to 
settle when the ADC2y multiplexer selects one of the supply voltage measurements. Increasing the multiplexer 
delay time provides more time for the input signal to settle after the multiplexer change before ADC2y starts 
converting. Setting the multiplexer delay time equal to or greater than 256 × tMCLK provides sufficient time for the 
input signals to settle when measuring the supply voltages.
If increasing the multiplexer delay time is not possible, because the delay time affects all sequence steps 
equally, configure multiple consecutive sequence steps for the same supply voltage measurement. Then 
disregard the initial sequence step readings where the conversions are not settled yet.
The input impedance of ADC2y changes with the selected conversion time, see the Electrical Characteristics 
table. The impedance of the resistor divider interacts with the input impedance of ADC2y leading to a gain error. 
Increasing the ADC2y input impedance by increasing the ADC2y conversion time reduces the gain error for the 
supply voltage measurements.
See 图 7-26 for details on how the supply voltage measurement accuracy changes with the multiplexer delay 
time and the ADC2y conversion time.

# 9.3.8.11 Temperature Sensors (TSA, TSB)
The ADS131B24-Q1 integrates two independent temperature sensors, TSA and TSB, one in each section of the 
device. Use the temperature sensors to measure the die temperature of each section. The temperature sensors 
output a linear voltage that is proportional to temperature. The output voltage characteristics (TSOffset, TSTC) of 
the temperature sensors are specified in the Electrical Characteristics table.
Use ADC2A to measure the output signal of TSA. To select TSA for measurement, configure any of the ADC2A 
sequence steps (SEQ2A_STEPx_CH_P[3:0]) for TSA measurement. For best measurement performance, 
configure the respective sequence step for gain = 2 using the SEQ2A_STEPx_GAIN[1:0] bits. Correspondingly, 
use ADC2B to measure the output signal of TSB.
方程式 18 shows how to convert the measured temperature sensor output voltage to die temperature:
Die temperature [°C] = 25°C + (Measured voltage – TSOffset) / TSTC

# 9.3.8.12 Test DACs (TDACA, TDACB)
The ADS131B24-Q1 integrates two independent Test DACs, TDACA and TDACB, one in each section of the 
device. TDACA uses the voltage reference in section A (REFA), and TDACB uses the voltage reference in 
section B (REFB). Use the TDACy_VALUE[2:0] bits to set the Test DAC output voltage to one of eight available 
settings. The output voltage of Test DAC A can be applied as an input signal to any of the ADCs in section B 
for measurement to check the accuracy and integrity of the ADCxB signal chains, including the voltage reference 
(REFB). Use the respective ADCxB multiplexer configuration bits to select Test DAC A as an input signal. 
Correspondingly, the output voltage of Test DAC B can be applied as an input signal to any of the ADCs in 
section A for measurement.
Selecting the Test DAC as an input signal for multiple ADCs at the same time can degrade the measurement 
accuracy because of loading of the Test DAC output.

# 9.3.8.13 Open-Wire Detection
To detect potential pin fault conditions (such as open, short-to-adjacent pin, short-to-GND, or short-to-supply) 
on the individual ADC analog input pins, every ADC integrates a dedicated open-wire detection (OWD) current 
source and sink. See 图 9-2 and 图 9-7 for how the current sources and sinks are connected to the ADC 
inputs. The input path of ADC2y includes a series impedance of approximately 200 Ω, see 图 9-7. Consider the 
additional voltage drop across this impedance when enabling the current source or sink on any of the ADC2y 
inputs.

# 9.3.8.14 Open-Wire Detection Configuration
As listed in 表 9-21, every current source and sink offers individual configuration and control.

# 9.3.8.15 Missing Host Detection and MHD Pin
The ADS131B24-Q1 offers a missing host detection (MHD) monitor that detects when the host is not 
communicating with the device anymore. A watchdog timer checks the time between two SPI frames with valid 
commands including valid CRCs. If a valid command with a valid CRC is not received within the watchdog time 
window, the host is considered missing. There is no monitor fault flag that indicates a missing host, only the 
MHD pin is used to detect this fault.
To use the missing host detection mode, configure the GPIO0/MHD pin as output (GPIO0_DIR = 1b) and the 
GPIO0 source for missing host detection mode (GPIO0_SRC = 0b). When the watchdog times out, the MHD 
pin is set active. Enable the missing host detection mode by setting the MHD_CFG[1:0] bits to one of the three 
available watchdog timeout windows. To reset the MHD output after a missing host was detected, disable the 
missing host detection mode by setting MHD_CFG = 00b.
The actual output signal of the MHD pin when active or inactive depends on the GPIO0 format (GPIO0_FMT bit) 
and MHD pin polarity (MHD_POL bit) configuration. See the respective bit descriptions and the General-Purpose 
Digital Inputs and Outputs (GPIO0 to GPIO4) section for details.# 9.3.8.14 Missing Host Detection (MHD)
MHD pin is set active. Enable the missing host detection mode by setting the MHD_CFG[1:0] bits to one of the three available watchdog timeout windows. To reset the MHD output after a missing host was detected, disable the missing host detection mode by setting MHD_CFG = 00b. The actual output signal of the MHD pin when active or inactive depends on the GPIO0 format (GPIO0_FMT bit) and MHD pin polarity (MHD_POL bit) configuration. See the respective bit descriptions and the General-Purpose Digital Inputs and Outputs (GPIO0 to GPIO4) section for details. This part shows an example where the MHD pin is configured for a static low signal in an active state, and a static high signal in an inactive state. The pin can for example also be configured for a static low signal in an active state, and a PWM output signal with 50% duty cycle in an inactive state to act as some sort of heart beat signal as long as the device detects a valid host.

# 9.3.8.15 Overcurrent Comparators (OCCA, OCCB)
The ADS131B24-Q1 integrates two digital overcurrent comparators (OCCA, OCCB), that provide a faster response to overcurrent conditions than ADC1y, especially when ADC1y is operating at low data rates. The comparators use the ADC1y ΔΣ modulator (and therefore the same multiplexer and PGA settings as ADC1y) but with a separate digital fast filter that works in parallel to the main ADC1y digital filter. This fast filter is a sinc3 implementation with a fixed OSR of 64. The offset and gain calibration values (OCAL1y[23:0], GCAL1y[15:0]) for ADC1y do not affect the OCCy comparators, which means there is no user calibration of the overcurrent comparators possible. 
Enable the overcurrent comparators using the OCCy_EN bits. To use overcurrent comparator OCCy, ADC1y must be enabled (ADC1y_EN = 1b) as well so that the ADC1y modulator is active. However, conversions on ADC1y do not need to be started to use the overcurrent comparator function. The sinc3 filter of the comparator starts operating as soon as the OCCy_EN bit is set and runs independently of the conversion state of ADC1y. 
The digital fast filter of the comparator outputs 16-bit conversion results that are internally compared against a high and low threshold, configured by the OCCy_HIGH_TH[15:0] and OCCy_LOW_TH[15:0] register bits, respectively. The comparator triggers when the conversion results exceed the high threshold or when the results fall below the low threshold. Set OCCy_HIGH_TH[15:0] = 7FFFh to disable the high threshold detection. Similarly, set OCCy_LOW_TH[15:0] = 8000h to disable the low threshold detection. 
OCCy_NUM[4:0] configures the number of conversions that the output of the digital fast filter must exceed the programmed high or low threshold before flagging an overcurrent condition in the OCCy_HTn or OCCy_LTn status bits, respectively. An internal counter keeps track of the number of conversions that exceed either the high or low threshold. The counter resets as soon as one conversion result drops below the threshold again or when the OCCy comparator is disabled (OCCy_EN = 0b). 
Disable the overcurrent comparator (OCCy_EN = 0b) before changing any comparator settings in the OCCy_CFG, OCCy_HIGH_THRESHOLD, or OCCy_LOW_THRESHOLD registers. 
Similar to the detailed supply, clo# 9.3.8.15 Overcurrent Indication Response Time
The fault indication response time to an overcurrent event depends on the amount of overshoot of the input 
signal beyond the comparator threshold. The reason for this dependency is the settling time of the sinc3 filter 
that is used for the digital comparator function.
图 9-14 and 图 9-15 show two examples for the OCCA fault indication behavior with OCCA_NUM[4:0] = 00000b, 
that is only one conversion must exceed the threshold to trigger a fault. In 图 9-14 the comparator triggers in 
less than 64/fMOD (= 15.6 μs when using fMCLK = 8.192 MHz) because the sinc3 filter already settles to a value 
above the set high threshold in one conversion due to the large overshoot beyond the high threshold on the 
input signal.
图 9-15 shows a worst case scenario where the sinc3 filter needs even four conversion periods to 
settle to a value above the set high threshold because the input signal barely exceeds the high threshold and the 
overcurrent event happens in the middle of a fast filter conversion.# 9.4 Device Functional Modes
on must exceed the threshold to trigger a fault. In 图 9-14 the comparator triggers in less than 64/fMOD (= 15.6 μs when using fMCLK = 8.192 MHz) because the sinc3 filter already settles to a value above the set high threshold in one conversion due to the large overshoot beyond the high threshold on the input signal. 
图 9-15 shows a worst case scenario where the sinc3 filter needs even four conversion periods to settle to a value above the set high threshold because the input signal barely exceeds the high threshold and the overcurrent event happens in the middle of a fast filter conversion cycle.
The response time changes when global-chop mode of ADC1y is enabled and ADC1y is converting. See the Overcurrent Indication Response Time in Global-Chop Mode section for details.

# 9.4.1 Power-Up and Reset
The ADS131B24-Q1 is reset in one three ways: Power-on reset (POR), RESETn pin (hardware reset), RESET command (software reset). After a reset occurs, the user registers reset to the respective default settings and the device is in active mode. All ADCs are enabled, but no conversions are started. With all three reset options, a low-to-high transition on the DRDYn pin indicates that the SPI interface is ready for communication. The device ignores any SPI communication before this point and SDO stays low.

# 9.4.1.1 Power-On Reset (POR)
Power-on reset (POR) is the reset that occurs when valid supply voltages are first applied to the device. The POR process requires tPOR to complete from when all supply voltages exceed the respective POR thresholds (AVDD_POR_TH, IOVDD_POR_TH, and DVDD_POR_TH) to allow the internal circuitry to power up. The DRDYn pin transitions from low to high immediately after tPOR, indicating the SPI interface is ready for communication.

# 9.4.1.2 RESETn Pin
The RESETn pin is an active low pin with an internal pulldown resistor to DGND. The device resets if the pin is held low for longer than tw(RSL) and maintains a reset state until the RESETn pin is returned high. The host must actively drive the pin high for the device to operate. Wait for at least tREGACQ after the RESETn pin is brought high or for the DRDYn rising edge before communicating with the device.

# 9.4.1.3 RESET Command
The ADS131B24-Q1 can be reset with the SPI RESET command. See the RESET section for details. A device reset occurs immediately after the RESET command is latched. The host must wait for at least tREGACQ or for the DRDYn rising edge before communicating with the device.

# 9.4.2 Operating Modes
The ADS131B24-Q1 offers three operating modes: active, standby, and power-down mode. The mode is programmable using the OP_MODE[1:0] bits. 图 9-16 shows how the device transitions between the different operating modes.

# 9.4.2.1 Active Mode
Active mode is the default operating mode after power-up or reset. In active mode, all internal circuitry is powered up. By default, all ADCs are enabled, but no conversions are started. The individual ADCs can be enabled or disabled using the respective ADCxy_EN bits. ADC conversions can only be started in active mode and when the respective ADC is enabled.

# 9.4.2.2 Standby Mode
In standby mode, all internal circuitry is powered up, but all ADCs are disabled and ongoing conversions are stopped immediately irrespective of the ADCxy_EN bit settings. No ADC conversions can be started in standby mode. Transition the device to standby mode before changing the main clock source using the CLK_SOURCE bit to prevent clock glitching during the clock switchover.

# 9.4.2.3 Power-Down Mode
In power-down mode, all nonessential internal circuitry (such as the ADCs, voltage references, and oscillators) is powered down. The LDOs and POR circuitry stay active. Register settings are retained in power-down mode. All ADCs are disabled and ongoing conversions are stopped immediately irrespective of the ADCxy_EN bit settings. No conversions can be started in power-down mode. When transitioning to active mode, wait for the voltage reference start-up time before starting any conversions to allow the voltage references to power up.

# 9.4.3 ADC Conversion Modes

# 9.4.3.1 ADC1y Conversion Modes
The ADS131B24-Q1 offers two conversion modes for ADCs ADC1y: continuous-conversion and single-shot conversion mode.
The CONV_MODE1A bit selects the conversion mode for ADC1y.
Do not change the contents of the following registers while conversions on ADC1y are ongoing: ADC1y_CFG, ADC1y_OCAL_MSB, ADC1y_OCAL_LSB, and ADC1y_GCAL. Stop conversions or disable ADC1y before making changes to these registers.

# 9.4.3.1.1 Continuous-Conversion Mode
In continuous-conversion mode, ADC1y converts indefinitely until stopped by the host. Set the respective STARTy bits in the CONVERSION_CTRL register to start conversions of the enabled ADC, ADC1y. Conversions on ADC1A and ADC1B can be started at different times using the respective STARTA and STARTB bits. Setting the STARTy bit while conversions are ongoing on an ADC aborts the ongoing conversion and restarts conversions. Use the STOPy bits to stop conversions of the enabled ADC, ADC1y. The currently ongoing conversion is allowed to finish after the STOPy bit is set and the digital filter is held in reset thereafter. After setting the STOPy bits, the STOPy bits read back 1b until conversions are stopped.
The STARTy bits take priority over the STOPy bits. That means if both the STARTy and STOPy bits in the CONVERSION_CTRL register are set at the same time, then conversions are started or ongoing conversions are aborted and new conversions are started.
The last conversion result of an ADC is still available for readout after conversions are stopped. The conversion results of an ADC are only cleared after a device reset, when the ADC is disabled, when the device is in standby or power-down mode, or are overwritten when a new conversion result becomes available.
The STARTy bits take effect and conversions start at# 9.4.3.1.1 Continuous-Conversion Mode
The STARTy bits in the CONVERSION_CTRL register have priority over the STOPy bits. That means if both the STARTy and STOPy bits in the CONVERSION_CTRL register are set at the same time, then conversions are started or ongoing conversions are aborted and new conversions are started.
The last conversion result of an ADC is still available for readout after conversions are stopped. The conversion results of an ADC are only cleared after a device reset, when the ADC is disabled, when the device is in standby or power-down mode, or are overwritten when a new conversion result becomes available.
The STARTy bits take effect and conversions start at the last SCLK falling edge of the register data CRC word within the SPI frame where the CONVERSION_CTRL register is written. See the Serial Interface Communication Structure section for details on the SPI frame of a register write command.
Setting the STARTy bit drives the DRDYn pin high if DRDYn was low, however the old conversion data can still be read until the new conversions become available.
ADC1y use a sinc3 digital filter that requires three conversion periods to settle. When conversions are started or restarted using the STARTy bits, the device hides the first two unsettled conversions and only provides a settled conversion result after the third conversion period. Use factor 19 to calculate the time until the first conversion after a conversion start is available. All subsequent conversions have a conversion period, as shown in Figure 9-17, of tDATA = 1 / fDATA = OSR / fMOD.

|---|---|
| tSETTLE | (3 × OSR + 44) × tMOD |
| DRDYn | tSETTLE |
| tDATA | tDATA |
| new conversions | new conversions |
---table end---

# 9.4.3.1.2 Single-Shot Conversion Mode
In single-shot conversion mode, ADC ADC1y performs one single conversion after the STARTy bit is set. Setting the STARTy bit while a conversion is ongoing on an ADC aborts the ongoing conversion and restarts a single new conversion. The STOPy bits have no effect in single-shot conversion mode.
Equivalent to continuous-conversion mode, the STARTy bits take effect and conversions start at the last SCLK falling edge of the register data CRC word within the SPI frame where the CONVERSION_CTRL register is written.
Every conversion in single-shot conversion mode is available after the first-conversion settling time as calculated by formula 19. If an input step change occurs during the conversion process, the conversion result is not fully settled. Another subsequent single-shot conversion is required in that case to output a settled conversion result.

# 9.4.3.1.3 Global-Chop Mode
The signal chain of ADC1y uses a very low-drift, chopper-stabilized PGA and ΣΔ-modulator to provide very low offset error and offset drift. However, a small amount of offset drift remains in normal measurement. For that reason, the ADC1y signal chain incorporates an optional global-chop mode to reduce offset error and offset drift over both temperature and time to exceptionally low levels.# 9.4.3.1.3 Global-Chop Mode
The signal chain of ADC1y uses a very low-drift, chopper-stabilized PGA and ΣΔ-modulator to provide very low offset error and offset drift. However, a small amount of offset drift remains in normal measurement. For that reason, the ADC1y signal chain incorporates an optional global-chop mode to reduce offset error and offset drift over both temperature and time to exceptionally low levels.
When the global-chop mode is enabled by setting the GC1y_EN bit, ADC1y performs two consecutive conversions with alternate input signal polarity to cancel offset error. The first conversion is taken with normal input polarity. The global-chop control logic inverts the input polarity and resets the digital filter for the second conversion. The average of the two conversions yields the final corrected result, removing the offset voltage.
Global-chop mode reduces the ADC1y noise by a factor of √2 because two conversions are averaged. Divide the input-referred noise values in 表 8-1 by √2 to derive the noise performance when global-chop mode is enabled.
The notches of the sinc3 filter in 图 9-3 do not change in global-chop mode. However, additional filter notches appear at multiples of fGC_DATA / 2.

# 9.4.3.1.3.1 Operational Sequence of Global-chop Mode
The operational sequence of global-chop mode is as follows:

| C1 | VCPA – VCNA – VOFS | First conversion withheld after conversion start |
| C2 | VCNA – VCPA – VOFS | Output 1 = (VC1 – VC2) / 2 = VCPA – VCNA |
| C3 | VCPA – VCNA – VOFS | Output 2 = (VC3 – VC2) / 2 = VCPA – VCNA |
---table end---
The first conversion result (Output 1) after a conversion start is available after ADC1y takes two settled conversions. Because of the sinc3 filter, data of one conversion settles in three conversions cycles. 方程式 20 calculates the time required to output the first conversion result after a conversion start.
In continuous-conversion mode with the global-chop mode enabled, subsequent conversions complete in tGC_DATA, as calculated by 方程式 21 and shown in 图 9-20. That means the data rate in global-chop mode is approximately 1/3rd the data rate in normal mode.

# 9.4.3.1.3.1 Overcurrent Indication
*To be continued.*# 9.4.3.1.3.1 Overcurrent Indication Response Time in Global-Chop Mode
Enabling global-chop mode of ADC1y changes the overcurrent detection behavior of OCCy when ADC1y is converting. The OCCy digital fast filter resets each time ADC1y inverts the polarity of the analog inputs. After every fast filter reset, the device ignores the first two conversions of the OCCy filter because these conversions are unsettled. The device does not increment the OCCy_NUM counter for these two conversions. Depending on the OCCy_NUM and OSR1y settings, the overcurrent indication response time in global-chop mode can therefore be longer compared to when global-chop mode is disabled. The difference in response time is most noticeable when using large OCCy_NUM and small OSR1y settings.

# 9.4.3.2 ADC2y Sequencer Operation and Sequence Modes 
In contrast to ADC1y, conversions on ADC2y are controlled by means of a channel sequencer. 图 9-22 depicts a flow chart of the sequencer operation. The ADC2y sequencer has up to 16 sequence steps that are individually enabled or disabled using the SEQ2y_STEPn_EN bits (n = 0 to 15). Each sequence step corresponds to one single conversion of ADC2y, which means up to 16 different measurements can be taken in one sequence run. The SEQ2y_STEPn_CFG registers configure the PGA gain, and the positive and negative input for the PGA for every sequence step. When a sequence is started, the sequencer steps through all enabled sequence steps, always starting with step 0. The sequencer ignores sequence steps that are disabled. One conversion is taken by ADC2y in each step before the sequencer configures ADC2y for the next step in the sequence. After the sequencer configures ADC2y for the next sequence step, the sequencer adds a programmable delay before starting the conversion to allow for settling of the input signal. The MUX2y_DELAY[2:0] bits select the delay time globally for all sequence steps. The time required to complete a sequence is given by 方程式 22: tSEQ = N × (tMUX_# 1. Sequence Steps Overview

One conversion is taken by ADC2y in each step before the sequencer configures ADC2y for the next step in the sequence. After the sequencer configures ADC2y for the next sequence step, the sequencer adds a programmable delay before starting the conversion to allow for settling of the input signal. The MUX2y_DELAY[2:0] bits select the delay time globally for all sequence steps. The time required to complete a sequence is given by 方程式 22: tSEQ = N × (tMUX_DELAY + tCONVERSION) where: 
- N is the number of enabled steps
- tMUX_DELAY is the multiplexer delay time
- tCONVERSION is the conversion time of ADC2y

# 2. Sequence Steps Register Management
While a sequence is ongoing, the SEQ2y_ACTIVE bit is set in the STATUS register. Do not make any changes to registers in the address range from 0x8C to 0x9F while ADC2A is enabled, and make no changes to registers in the address range from 0xCC to 0xCF while ADC2B is enabled.

# 3. Sequence Configuration
To avoid false sequencer starts, follow this procedure to configure and start the sequencer:
1. Disable ADC2y by setting ADC2y_EN = 0b, or alternatively put the device into standby mode
2. Configure the ADC2y sequencer register bits
3. Enable ADC2y by setting ADC2y_EN = 1b, or alternatively put the device back into active mode
4. Start the sequence by setting the SEQ2y_START bit
Setting the SEQ2y_START bit while ADC2y is disabled does not start a sequence.

# 4. Conversion Data for Sequence Steps
Conversion data for the sequence steps of ADC2y are 16 bits and (in contrast to ADC1y conversion data) are stored in the user register space (register addresses 10h to 2Fh). The conversion data for sequence step n are stored in the corresponding SEQ2y_STEPn_DATA register. Conversion data for a sequence step that is disabled are set to 0000h. Read ADC2y conversion data using the register read command.
The conversion data of all SEQ2y_STEPn_DATA registers only update when a sequence run of ADC2y completes. While a sequence run is ongoing, the conversion data of the previous sequence run are read from the SEQ2y_STEPn_DATA registers. There is no data corruption or mix of data from two different sequence runs, even when a sequence completes while the SEQ2y_STEPn_DATA registers are read.

# 5. ADC2y Sequencer Modes
The ADC2y sequencer offers three sequence modes:
- Continuous sequence mode
- Single-shot sequence mode
- Synchronized single-shot sequence mode based on ADC1y conversion starts
The SEQ2y_MODE[1:0] bits select the sequence mode for ADC2y.

| - | - | Start or Stop Sequence | SEQ2y_STOP Bit = 1b? | - | Data from disabled steps are set to 0000h. | - | - |
---table end---
This process runs in the background. It doe-# 9.4.3.2.1 Continuous Sequence Mode
In continuous sequence mode, the ADC2y sequencer runs through the configured sequence over and over 
again until stopped by the host. Set the respective SEQ2y_START bit in the CONVERSION_CTRL register to 
start the sequencer of ADC2y. Setting the SEQ2y_START bit while the sequencer is running aborts the ongoing 
sequence run and restarts a new sequence run from the beginning. Use the SEQ2y_STOP bit to stop the 
sequencer of ADC2y. The currently ongoing sequence run is allowed to finish after the SEQ2y_STOP bit is set. 
After setting the SEQ2y_STOP bit, the SEQ2y_STOP bit reads back 1b until the sequencer stopped. Disabling 
ADC2y or putting the device into standby or power-down mode aborts the sequence run immediately.
The SEQ2y_START bits take priority over the SEQ2y_STOP bits. That means if both the SEQ2y_START and 
SEQ2y_STOP bits in the CONVERSION_CTRL register are set at the same time, then the sequencer starts a 
sequence run or aborts an ongoing sequence run and starts a new sequence run from the beginning.
The last conversion results of an ADC2y sequence run are still available for readout after the sequencer 
stopped. The conversion results of the sequencer are only cleared to 0000h after a device reset, when the ADC 
is disabled, when the device is in standby or power-down mode, or are overwritten when conversion results from 
a new sequence run become available.

# 9.4.3.2.2 Single-Shot Sequence Mode
In single-shot sequence mode the ADC2y sequencer runs through the configured sequence one time after 
the SEQ2y_START bit is set. Setting the SEQ2y_START bit while a sequence is ongoing aborts the ongoing 
sequence and restarts a single new sequence run from the beginning. The SEQ2y_STOP bit has no effect in 
single-shot sequence mode.

# 9.4.3.2.3 Synchronized Single-Shot Sequence Mode Based on ADC1y Conversion Starts
The synchronized sequence mode allows the sequence starts of ADC2A to be synchronized with the conversion 
starts of ADC1A or the sequence starts of ADC2B to be synchronized with the conversion starts of ADC1B. In 
this mode a single sequence run is started on ADC2y whenever a new conversion on ADC1y starts. However, 
an ongoing sequence run on ADC2y does not abort and restart when a new conversion on ADC1y starts. 
This means a single new sequence run on ADC2y is only triggered by ADC1y when no sequence is currently 
ongoing.
Start the ADC2y sequencer initially by setting the SEQ2y_START bit.
The synchronized single-shot sequence mode is only useful when ADC1y is configured for continuous-
conversion mode. When ADC1y is configured for single-shot conversion mode, synchronize conversions of 
ADC1y and sequence starts of ADC2y by setting the STARTy and SEQy_START bits at the same time.

This process runs in the background. It does not prevent the sequencer from starting a new sequence run.# 9. Synchronizing ADC1A Conversions and ADC2A Sequence Starts
This means a single new sequence run on ADC2y is only triggered by ADC1y when no sequence is currently ongoing. Start the ADC2y sequencer initially by setting the SEQ2y_START bit. The synchronized single-shot sequence mode is only useful when ADC1y is configured for continuous-conversion mode. When ADC1y is configured for single-shot conversion mode, synchronize conversions of ADC1y and sequence starts of ADC2y by setting the STARTy and SEQy_START bits at the same time. 图 9-23 shows an example of how ADC1A conversions and ADC2A sequence starts are synchronized.

# 9.5 Programming 

# 9.5.1 Serial Interface 
The ADS131B24-Q1 uses an SPI-compatible interface to configure the device and retrieve conversion data. The device always acts as an SPI peripheral; SCLK and CSn are inputs to the interface. The interface operates in SPI mode 1 where CPOL = 0 and CPHA = 1. In SPI mode 1, SCLK idles low and data are launched or changed only on SCLK rising edges; data are latched or read by the controller and peripheral on SCLK falling edges. The interface is full-duplex, meaning data can be sent and received simultaneously by the interface. The device includes the typical SPI signals: CSn, SCLK, SDI, and SDO. In addition, the DRDYn pin serves as a flag to the host to indicate new conversion data are available.

# 9.5.1.1 Serial Interface Signals 

# 9.5.1.1.1 Chip Select (CSn) 
The CSn pin is an active low input signal that selects the device for communication. The device ignores any communication and SDO is high impedance when CSn is held high. Hold CSn low for the duration of a communication frame to ensure proper communication. The interface is reset each time CSn is taken high.

# 9.5.1.1.2 Serial Data Clock (SCLK) 
The SCLK pin is an input that serves as the serial clock for the interface. Output data on SDO transition on the rising edge of SCLK and input data on SDI are latched on the falling edge of SCLK.

# 9.5.1.1.3 Serial Data Input (SDI) 
The SDI pin is the serial data input pin for the device. Serial commands are shifted in through the SDI pin by the device with each SCLK falling edge when the CSn pin is low.

# 9.5.1.1.4 Serial Data Output (SDO) 
The SDO pin is the serial data output pin for the device. The device shifts out data serially with each rising SCLK edge when the CSn pin is low. This pin assumes a high-impedance state when CSn is high. When CSn transitions low, the SDO pin drives low.SDO stays at the level of the last bit sent if the host does not send any extra SCLK pulses after the last data is shifted out on SDO. If the host sends additional SCLK pulses after the last data is shifted out, then SDO drives low. 图 9-24 and 图 9-25 show timing diagrams of the SDO behavior both without and with additional SCLK pulses, respectively.

# 9.5.1.1.5 Data Ready 

# 9.5.1.1.5 Data Ready (DRDYn)
The DRDYn pin is an active-low, push-pull output. A DRDYn falling edge indicates when new conversion data of ADC1A or ADC1B are available for readout. The DRDY_CTRL bit selects which ADC drives the DRDYn signal, either ADC1A or ADC1B. If the host starts ADC1A and ADC1B conversions at the same time by setting both the STARTA and STARTB bits during the same CONVERSION_CTRL register write, conversions of both ADCs complete at the same time. The period between DRDYn falling edges is the data rate period of the ADC that controls the DRDYn pin. During device power up or while the device is held in reset, the DRDYn pin drives low. As shown in 图 9 26 and 图 9-27, the DRDYn pin drives high after the POR is released and the device is ready for communication. 

# 9.5.1.2 Serial Interface Communication Structure

# 9.5.1.2.1 SPI Communication Frames
SPI communication on the ADS131B24-Q1 is performed in frames. Each SPI communication frame starts with a CSn falling edge, consists of several words, and ends with a CSn rising edge. The interface is full duplex, meaning that the interface is capable of transmitting data on SDO while simultaneously receiving data on SDI. 图 9-28 provides an overview of the general SPI frame structure and frame length for the various commands. The input frame that the host sends on SDI always begins with a command word followed by a command CRC word. The first word on the output frame that the device transmits on SDO always begins with the STATUS word. The number of words in a frame depends on the command provided. See the Commands section for a list of all valid commands on the ADS131B24-Q1. For the NULL, RESET, LOCK, UNLOCK, and RREG commands there are four words in a frame. On SDI, the host provides the command, the command CRC, and two additional words of zeros. Simultaneously on SDO, the device outputs the STATUS word, two words of ADC data (representing the data from ADC1A and ADC1.# 9.5.1.2 Communication Protocol
a command word followed by a command CRC word. The first word on the output frame that the device transmits on SDO always begins with the STATUS word. The number of words in a frame depends on the command provided. See the Commands section for a list of all valid commands on the ADS131B24-Q1. For the NULL, RESET, LOCK, UNLOCK, and RREG commands there are four words in a frame. On SDI, the host provides the command, the command CRC, and two additional words of zeros. Simultaneously on SDO, the device outputs the STATUS word, two words of ADC data (representing the data from ADC1A and ADC1B), and an output CRC word.

# 9.5.1.3 Typical Communication Frame Structure
图 9-28 shows a typical communication frame structure. In the remaining sections of this document the SCLK signal is omitted in the figures for clarity.

# 9.5.1.4 Write Register Command
For a write register (WREG) command where more than one register is written, the frame extends to accommodate the additional data. See the WREG section for more details on the WREG command.

# 9.5.1.5 Read Register Command
For a read register (RREG) command, the response to the command in the following frame contains the STATUS word followed by the register data requested, which can require a shorter or longer frame depending on how many registers are read. See the RREG section for more details on the RREG command.

# 9.5.1.6 SPI Communication Words
An SPI communication frame of the ADS131B24-Q1 is made of multiple words. The word size is configurable as either 24 bits, or 32 bits using the WORD_LENGTH bit in the DEVICE_CFG register. The content within each word is always most significant bit (MSB) aligned and least significant bit (LSB) padded with zeros to accommodate 24-bit or 32-bit word sizes.

---table end---

# 9.5.1.7 Bit Alignment & Zero Padding
图 9-29 and 图 9-30 show the bit alignments and zero padding within the individual words for a WREG and RREG command, respectively.

# 9.5.1.8 STATUS Word
The ADS131B24-Q1 outputs a STATUS word as the first word in every frame on SDO. The 24-bit STATUS word is a concatenation of the STATUS_MSB[15:0] and STATUS_LSB[15:8] register bits. Fault flags, status flags, ADC1A and ADC1B conversion counters, ADC2A and ADC2B sequence counters, and the command response are all part of these bits. See the respective register bit descriptions in the Register Map section for details.

# 9.5.1.9 Communication-related faults
Communication-related fault flags, such as the SPI_CRC_FAULTn, SPI_TIMEOUTn, SCLK_COUNT_FAULTn, and REG_ACCESS_FAULTn flags, always indicate faults that occurred in the previous SPI frame. These fault flags clear automatically.# 9.5.1.2.4 Communication Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
The ADS131B24-Q1 features a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) engine on both input and output data to detect SPI communication errors. Overall there are three different CRCs that are all 16 bits wide:
• On SDI: Command CRC and, in case of a WREG command, a register data CRC
• On SDO: Output CRC
The command CRC covers the command word (that is, the first word on SDI in every frame). The WREG command is a special case that requires an additional register data CRC. The register data CRC covers the register data words transmitted after the command CRC word. The output CRC covers all words on SDO preceding the output CRC word. The CRCs also cover all zero-padded bits.
The device checks the provided command CRC, and (in case of a WREG command) the register data CRC against the internally calculated CRCs based on the received input data. A CRC error occurs if the CRC words do not match. The device does not execute any commands if the command CRC or register data CRC checks fail. The device sets the SPI_CRC_FAULTn bit in the STATUS_MSB register for all cases of a CRC error on the input data.
The response on the output in the SPI frame following a frame where a CRC error occurred is that of a NULL command, which means the STATUS word plus the conversion data for ADC1A and ADC1B are output in the following SPI frame. The SPI_CRC_FAULTn bit is output as part of the STATUS word to provide immediate indication that a CRC error occurred in the previous frame. The SPI_CRC_FAULTn bit clears automatically in the next SPI frame.
There are two types of CRC polynomials available: CCITT CRC and ANSI CRC (CRC-16). The CRC polynomial setting determines the algorithm for all three CRCs. The CRC type is programmed using the CRC_TYPE bit.

# 9.5.1.2.5.1 NULL (0000 0000 0000 0000b)
The NULL command is the no-operation command that results in no registers being read or written, and the 
state of the device remains unchanged. The intended use case for the NULL command is to read out conversion 
data for ADC1A and ADC1B.
The command response in the next frame indicates if an error occurred during the transmission of the NULL 
command frame. However, a NULL command is executed regardless if an error occurred or not.

# 9.5.1.2.5.2 RESET (0000 0000 0001 0001b)
The RESET command resets the device and sets all user registers to the respective default values. The 
command is latched by the device at the last SCLK falling edge of the output CRC word. Terminating the frame 
before the output CRC word is shifted out on SDO causes the RESET command to be ignored. A reset occurs 
immediately after the command is latched.

The LOCK command locks the interface, preve# 9.5.1.2.5.3 LOCK (0000 0101 0101 0101b)
The LOCK command locks the interface, preventing the device from accidentally latching unwanted commands 
that can change the state of the device. When the interface is locked, the device only responds to the NULL, 
RREG, and UNLOCK commands. The device continues to output conversion data even when locked.
The LOCK status bit and the command response in the next frame indicate if the LOCK command executed 
successfully or if an error occurred that prevented the LOCK command from executing. A NULL command is 
executed if the LOCK command did not execute.

# 9.5.1.2.5.3 RREG Command Detail 
RREG is used to read the device registers. The binary format of the command word is 101a aaaa aaan nnnn, where a aaaa aaa is the binary address of the register to begin reading from and n nnnn is the unsigned binary number of consecutive registers to read minus one. The device outputs the requested register data sequentially in order of addresses in the following frame instead of the conversion data of ADC1A and ADC1B. If more than two registers are read, the frame extends beyond the regular four words.
Send the NULL command in the frame following the RREG command frame to shift out the register data. No other command is accepted in the frame following the RREG command frame.
The 16-bit register data are MSB aligned within the individual words. As illustrated in 图 9-30, the device outputs the respective 8-bit register address following the register data within each word for traceability. When reading from an invalid register address, the device responds with 0000h for the register data and 00h for the register address.
The command response in the frame following the RREG command frame indicates if the RREG command executed successfully or if an error occurred that prevented the RREG command from executing. A NULL command is executed if the RREG command did not execute.

# 9.5.1.2.6 SCLK Counter
The ADS131B24-Q1 implements an SCLK counter that counts the received SCLK pulses within a frame. If the number of received SCLK pulses does not match the number of SCLKs to complete a specific frame, then the SCLK_COUNT_FAULTn flag is set in the following frame. Enable or disable the SCLK counter using the SCLK_COUNTER_EN bit.
The device determines the number of SCLKs expected for a specific SPI frame at the end of the command CRC word. Both the expected number of words to be received on SDI and the words to be transmitted on SDO are considered in the SCLK count calculation. The larger of the two values determines the SCLK count for the frame. For example, the SCLK count in the two frames in 图 9-35 is (4 × NWORD_LENGTH), while in 图 9-36 the SCLK count for the frame is (9 × NWORD_LENGTH). The data word length, NWORD_LENGTH, is either 24 or 32, as configured by the WORD_LENGTH bit.
Sending more SCLK pulses than required to complete a frame does not impact the SPI communication, however the SCLK_COUNT_FAULTn does still set in that case to indicate that too many SCLKs were received.
Sending insufficient SCLK pulses to complete a frame does impact the SPI communication in certain situations:
* NULL command: No effect.
* RESET command: Does not execute until sufficient SCLK pulses are provided to clock out the complete output CRC word on SDO.
* LOCK, UNLOCK, RREG commands: Do execute if at least the command and command CRC words are received on SDI.
* WREG command: Does execute if at least the command, command CRC, register data, and register data CRC words are received on SDI.
* DRDYn pin: The DRDYn pin only transitions high after the conversion data word for ADC1B is clocked out on SDO. Otherwise, the device assumes the host did not receive the latest conversion data and the DRDYn pin stays low.

# 9.5.1.2.7 SPI Timeout
The ADS131B24-Q1 implements an SPI timeout feature that measures the time between the CSn falling and CSn rising edge within a frame. If the CSn rising edge does not occur within the SPI timeout period (tTIMEOUT) after the CSn falling edge, then the SPI_TIMEOUTn flag is set in the following frame. When a timeout occurs, the rest of the SPI frame on SDI is ignored before the rising edge of CSn. A new SPI transaction starts at the next CSn falling edge. Enable or disable the SPI timeout using the TIMEOUT_EN bit.
If the SPI times out after a complete frame was transmitted on SDI and SDO already, then there is no impact to the SPI communication, however the SPI_TIMEOUTn flag does still set in that case to indicate that the CSn signal was held low for too long.
If the SPI times out before a complete frame is transmitted on SDI and SDO, then there is potential impact to the SPI communication in certain situations:
* NULL command: No effect.
* RESET command: Does not execute until the complete output CRC word is clocked out on SDO before the SPI times out.
* LOCK, UNLOCK, RREG commands: Do execute if at least the command and command CRC words are received on SDI before the SPI times out.
* WREG command: Does execute if at least the command, command CRC, register data, and register data CRC words are received on SDI before the SPI times out.
* DRDYn pin: The DRDYn pin only transitions high after the conversion data word for ADC1B is clocked out on SDO before the SPI times out. Otherwise, the device assumes the host did not receive the latest conversion data and the DRDYn pin stays low.

# 9.5.1.2.8 Reading ADC1A, ADC1B, ADC2A, and ADC2B Conve

# 9.5.1.2.8 Reading ADC1A, ADC1B, ADC2A, and ADC2B Conversion Data
Conversion data from all four ADCs of the ADS131B24-Q1 can be read within two SPI frames. Conversion data for ADC1A and ADC1B are always output as the response to a NULL command in the following SPI frame. Conversion data for ADC2A and ADC2B must be read from the user registers using the RREG command. The conversion results for the various sequence steps of ADC2A and ADC2B are stored in consecutive register address locations starting at register address 10h. The RREG command allows to read up to 32 consecutive registers within one SPI frame, which is sufficient to read conversion data for all sequence steps of ADC2A and ADC2B.
Between one and 32 conversion results can be read from ADC2A and ADC2B within one SPI frame.

# 9.5.1.2.9 DRDYn Pin Behavior
This section provides details about the DRDYn pin behavior in various scenarios.
DRDYn transitions low whenever new conversion data complete on ADC1A or ADC1B, depending on which ADC drives the DRDYn signal as configured in the DRDY_CTRL bit. If DRDYn is low when a new conversion completes on ADC1y, then DRDYn drives high tw(DRH) before the DRDYn falling edge.
DRDYn transitions high after the conversion data for ADC1B are retrieved on SDO (图 9-39). If CSn is driven high before the ADC1B conversion data are retrieved, then DRDYn stays low, indicating that not all conversion data were read (图 9-40 and 图 9-41).
图 9-41 shows that the same conversion data can be read multiple times until new conversions complete. The ADC1y conversion counters indicate if the same data were read again or if new data were read.
The device avoids data corruption if new conversions n+1 complete while conversion data n are being read. Conversion data n+1 are held in an internal buffer until the read of conversion data n is complete. In the following frame, conversion data n+1 are loaded into the SDO output buffer. DRDYn does not transition high after conversion data n have been read in this case to indicate that new conversion data n+1 are available for readout (see 图 9-42).
图 9-43 illustrates that conversion data n+1 are lost when the host does not read the data before conversions n+2 complete. The ADC1y conversion counters are helpful in this situation to detect if the host missed reading the intermediate conversion results.

Setting the STARTy bit drives the DRDYn pin high at the last SCLK falling edge of the register data CRC word within the SPI frame where the CONVERSION_CTRL register is written. However, the old conversion data can still be read until the new conversions become available. 图 9-44 shows the device behavior when setting the STARTy bit to abort an ongoing conversion and to restart new conversions while reading out conversion data. 图 9-45 shows a scenario where new conversions complete while setting the STARTy bit and reading out conversion data.

|----|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 6:3 | COMMAND_RESPONSE[3:0] | R | 1001b | Command response indication
Indicates which command was executed in the previous SPI frame.
0000b = Invalid response that does not occur under normal circumstances. Can indicate a 
stuck-at SDO signal or that the device is held in reset. 
0001b = NULL command 
0010b = LOCK command 
0011b = UNLOCK command 
0100b = RREG command 
0101b = NULL command (because a NULL command was correctly sent as the second 
frame after a RREG command). This response serves as the frame counter for the two-
frame RREG command. 
0110b = WREG command 
0111b = Invalid response that does not occur under normal circumstances. |
---table end---

# 1. SPI Frame Information
in the previous SPI frame.
0000b = Invalid response that does not occur under normal circumstances. Can indicate a 
stuck-at SDO signal or that the device is held in reset. 
0001b = NULL command 
0010b = LOCK command 
0011b = UNLOCK command 
0100b = RREG command 
0101b = NULL command (because a NULL command was correctly sent as the second 
frame after a RREG command). This response serves as the frame counter for the two-
frame RREG command. 
0110b = WREG command 
0111b = Invalid response that does not occur under normal circumstances. 
1000b = Invalid response that does not occur under normal circumstances. 
1001b = NULL command (first frame after power-up or reset). This response is only sent 
in the first frame after reset or power-up, the second frame has the response based on the 
command sent in the first frame. 
1010b = NULL command (resulting from one of the following errors: a timeout occurred 
before a complete command CRC was received, insufficient SCLKs were sent to complete 
a command, a CRC mismatch between the command word and command CRC word, or a 
CRC mismatch between data words and the data CRC word in a WREG command). For the 
NULL, RREG, LOCK, and UNLOCK commands, the command and command CRC words 
must be sent to complete the command. For the RESET command, the STATUS word, all 
ADC data words, and the output CRC word must be read to complete the command. For the 
WREG command, the command and command CRC words, as well as the data and data 
CRC words must be sent to complete the command. 
1011b = NULL command (resulting from an invalid command word with a matching CRC 
between the command word and command CRC word). 
1100b = NULL command (resulting from a command other than the NULL command was 
sent in the second frame after the RREG command and ignored). This response serves as 
the frame counter for the two-frame RREG command. 
1101b = NULL command (the RESET or WREG commands are ignored because the device 
is locked). 
1110b = Invalid response that does not occur under normal circumstances. 
1111b = Invalid response that does not occur under normal circumstances. Can indicate a 
stuck-at SDO signal.

polarity of the OCCA pin. The actual output behavior of the GPIO3/OCCA pin, when configured as OCCA output in the GPIO3_SRC bit, depends on the GPIO3_FMT setting. An OCCA fault is active when any of the OCCA_HTn or OCCA_LTn bits are active. 0b = Active low. In case of a fault a logic low level is driven. 1b = Active high. In case of a fault a logic high level is driven.

# 10 Application and Implementation
备注: 以下应用部分中的信息不属于 TI 器件规格的范围，TI 不担保其准确性和完整性。TI 的客 户应负责确定器件是否适用于其应用。客户应验证并测试其设计，以确保系统功能。

# 10.1 Application Information

# 10.1.1 Unused Inputs and Outputs
Follow these guidelines for unused device pin connections:
- Leave any unused ADCxy analog inputs floating or connect the unused analog inputs to AGNDy.
- Tie unused GPIO pins (GPIO0 to GPIO4, GPIO0A, GPIO1A, GPIO0B, and GPIO1B) to DGND when configured as digital inputs because excessive power-supply current can result when digital inputs are left floating.
- Tie the CLK pin to DGND if the internal main oscillator is used.
- Tie the RESETn pin to IOVDD if the host does not drive the RESETn pin. The RESETn pin has an internal pulldown resistor to DGND.
- Leave the DRDYn pin unconnected if unused or connect the pin to IOVDD with a weak pullup resistor.

# 10.1.2 Minimum Interface Connections
The ADS131B24-Q1 requires at a minimum four pins for communication with a host microcontroller: CSn, SCLK, SDI, and SDO. CSn cannot be tied low permanently. The following pins are optional, but connecting these pins to the host helps with device operation:
- DRDYn: Helps determine exactly when new conversion data on ADC1A or ADC1B are available.
- RESETn: If the SPI communication is corrupted (that is, if the RESET command cannot be sent), a hardware reset is required to recover the device. Without controlling the RESETn pin, the only way to perform a hardware reset on the device is through cycling the power supplies.
- GPIOs: The different special functions available on the various GPIO pins, such as FAULT, MHD, OCCA, and OCCB, help alert the host of device or system faults.

# 10.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure
The following sections provide guidelines for selecting the external components and the configuration of the ADS131B24-Q1 for the various measurements in this application example.

# 10.2.2.1 Current Shunt Measurement
In a typical BMS application, the current through the shunt resistor must be measured in both directions for charging and discharging the battery pack. In an overcurrent or short-circuit condition, the current can be as high as IBAT_MAX = ±3 kA in this example application. Therefore, the maximum voltage drop across the shunt is up to VSHUNT = RSHUNT × IBAT_MAX = 50 μΩ × ±3 kA = ±150 mV.
To measure this shunt voltage, ADC1A is configured for gain = 8, which allows differential voltage measurements of VIN1A = VCPA – VCNA = ±VREFA / 8 = ±1.25 V / 8 = ±156 mV. The integrated charge pump in the device allows voltage measurements 312.5 mV below AGNDA while using a unipolar analog power supply.# 1. Battery Pack and Overcurrent Conditions
Both directions for charging and discharging the battery pack. In an overcurrent or short-circuit condition, the current can be as high as IBAT_MAX = ±3 kA in this example application. Therefore, the maximum voltage drop across the shunt is up to VSHUNT = RSHUNT × IBAT_MAX = 50 μΩ × ±3 kA = ±150 mV. To measure this shunt voltage, ADC1A is configured for gain = 8, which allows differential voltage measurements of VIN1A = VCPA – VCNA = ±VREFA / 8 = ±1.25 V / 8 = ±156 mV. The integrated charge pump in the device allows voltage measurements 312.5 mV below AGNDA while using a unipolar analog power supply. 
This bipolar voltage measurement capability is important because one side of the shunt is connected to the same GND potential as the AGNDA pin of the ADS131B24-Q1, which means that the absolute voltage that the device must measure is up to 150 mV below AGNDA.

# 2. Overcurrent Detection
To enable fast overcurrent detection within 1 ms while providing high accuracy and resolution, the ADS131B24-Q1 is configured to operate at 4 kSPS (OSR = 1024)) using global-chop mode. Global-chop mode enables measurements with minimal offset error over temperature and time. The conversion time using these settings is 0.75 ms according to Equation 21. The input-referred noise is approximately 1.28 μVRMS / √2 = 0.91 μVRMS following the explanations in the Global-Chop Mode section. Thus, currents as small as 0.91 μVRMS / 50 μΩ = 18 mA can be resolved. The resolution can be further improved by averaging the conversion results over a longer period of time in the microcontroller that interfaces with the ADS131B24-Q1.

# 3. Antialiasing Filter
The –3-dB corner frequency of the differential antialiasing filter on the analog inputs (R13, R14, and C6) is set to 1 / (2 × ᴨ × 2 × 100 Ω × 47 nF) = 16.9 kHz to provide more then 40-dB attenuation at the ADC1A modulator frequency. Keep the series resistor values (R13 and R14) small to avoid additional offset errors created by the voltage drop across the resistors because of the ADC1A input currents.
ADC1B is configured identical to ADC1A to allow for simultaneous sampling of the shunt voltage with the same digital filter response.

# 4. Battery Pack Voltage Measurement
The 800-V battery-pack voltage is divided down to the voltage range of ADC2A using a high-voltage resistor divider, consisting of R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5. Gain = 1 is used for ADC2A in this case to allow differential voltage measurements of VIN2A = VV0A – VAGNDA = ±1.25 V. The battery-pack voltage measurement is a unipolar, single-ended measurement with the negative multiplexer channel of ADC2A internally connected to AGNDA. 
Thus, only the voltage range from 0 V to 1.25 V of ADC2A is used. Equation 23 calculates the resistor divider ratio. VV0A / VBAT_MAX = 1.25 V / 800 V = R5 / (R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5)
(23)
The leakage current drawn by the resistor divider should be less than 100 μA in this example to avoid unnecessarily draining the battery. The resistance of the divider must therefore be larger than RTOTAL ≥ VBAT_MAX / ILEAKAGE = 800 V / 100 μA = 8 MΩ. The resistor values are chosen as R1 = R2 = R3 = R4 = 2 MΩ and R5 = 12 kΩ. Thus, the maximum voltage across R5 is 1.2 V at VBAT_MAX = 800 V, leaving some headroom to the maximum input voltage of 1.25 V of ADC2A.
The maximum resistance of a single resistor that can be used in an automotive circuit design is often limited to a certain value. Also, the maximum voltage a single resistor can withstand is limited. These reasons are why the high-side resistor of the divider is split into multiple resistors (R1, R2, R3, and R4).

# 10.2.2.2 High-Side Voltage Measurement
AL ≥
VBAT_MAX / ILEAKAGE = 800 V / 100 μA = 8 MΩ. The resistor values are chosen as R1 = R2 = R3 = R4 = 2 MΩ and 
R5 = 12 kΩ. Thus, the maximum voltage across R5 is 1.2 V at VBAT_MAX = 800 V, leaving some headroom to the 
maximum input voltage of 1.25 V of ADC2A.
The maximum resistance of a single resistor that can be used in an automotive circuit design is often limited to 
a certain value. Also, the maximum voltage a single resistor can withstand is limited. These reasons are why the 
high-side resistor of the divider is split into multiple resistors (R1, R2, R3, and R4). Another reason is that in case 
a single resistor has a short-circuit fault, the remaining resistors still limit the current into the ADC2A analog input 
pin, V0A, to safe levels.

# 10.2.2.3 Shunt Temperature Measurement
The shunt temperature in this example is measured using the TMP61-Q1, a linear 10-kΩ PTC, in a typical 
voltage divider configuration using the analog supply (AVDD) as excitation. The PTC resistance is calculated 
using 方程式 25, which is derived from 方程式 24:
VPTC = VV1A – VAGNDA = AVDD × RPTC / (R6 + RPTC) (24)
RPTC = R6 × VPTC / (AVDD – VPTC) (25)
The maximum input voltage on V1A is limited to 1.25 V when using gain = 1 for ADC2A with the negative 
multiplexer channel of ADC2A internally connected to AGNDA. Therefore, the value of the precision resistor, 
R6, must be chosen so that the voltage on V1A stays below 1.25 V for the value range of the PTC across the 
temperature range to be measured. The TMP61-Q1 has the largest resistance at the most positive temperature, 
approximately 18 kΩ at +125°C. Following 方程式 25, that means R6 ≥ 29.5 kΩ. A value of 34 kΩ is chosen for 
R6 to allow variation in the AVDD supply voltage up to 3.6 V without exceeding the maximum V1A voltage of 
1.25 V.

# 10.2.2.4 Analog Output Temperature Sensor Measurement
This application example shows a redundant shunt temperature measurement using an analog output 
temperature sensor, LMT84-Q1. The LMT84-Q1 outputs a voltage proportional to temperature, which spans 
from 1.247 V at –40°C to 0.332 V at +125°C. The temperature sensor output voltage is measured directly with 
ADC2B on analog input V1B with the negative multiplexer channel of ADC2A internally connected to AGNDB 
using gain = 1.

# 10-4 Power-Supply Architecture
The AVDD LDO accepts unregulated voltages between 4 V and 16 V on the APWR pin and outputs a regulated 3.3-V AVDD supply that is available at the AVDD pin to power external circuitry. The AVDD supply powers all analog circuitry in the device. If a regulated 3.3-V supply is available in the application, the AVDD LDO can be bypassed by shorting the APWR and AVDD pins.
The negative charge pumps in section A and section B provide a negative supply voltage for the various gain stages of every ADC to allow input voltage measurements below GND.
The IOVDD LDO accepts unregulated voltages between 4 V and 16 V on the DPWR pin and outputs a regulated 3.3-V IOVDD supply that is available at the IOVDD pin to power external circuitry. The IOVDD supply sets the voltage for the digital I/Os of the device. If a regulated 3.3-V or 5-V supply is available in the application, the IOVDD LDO can be bypassed by shorting the DPWR and IOVDD pins.
The DVDD LDO creates the 1.8-V supply for the digital core of the device.

# 10.3.1.1 Single Unregulated External 4-V to 16-V Supply (3.3-V Digital I/O Levels)
A single unregulated 4-V to 16-V supply (as shown in 图 10-5) connected to both the APWR and DPWR pins can be used to power the device. No external supply is provided at the AVDD and IOVDD pins in this case. The AVDD LDO creates the internal 3.3-V AVDD supply, and the IOVDD LDO creates the 3.3-V I/O supply.

# 10.3.1.2 Single Regulated External 3.3-V Supply (3.3-V Digital IO Levels)
A single regulated 3.3-V supply connected to both the APWR and DPWR pins (as shown in 图 10-6) can be used to power the device. In this case the APWR and AVDD pins must be shorted externally, as well as the DPWR and IOVDD pins. That way the AVDD and IOVDD LDOs are bypassed. The external 3.3-V supply is directly used as the AVDD and IOVDD supplies.

# 10.3.1.3 Single Regulated External 5-V Supply (5-V Digital I/O Levels)
To allow operation of the digital I/Os with 5-V levels, a single regulated 5-V supply (shown in 图 10-7) connected to both the APWR and DPWR pins can be used to power the device. No external supply is provided at the AVDD pin in this case. The AVDD LDO creates the internal 3.3-V AVDD supply. The DPWR and IOVDD pins must be shorted externally. That way the IOVDD LDO is bypassed. The external 5-V supply is directly used as the IOVDD supply.

# 10.3.2 Power-Supply Sequencing
The power supplies can be sequenced in any order but the analog and digital inputs must never exceed the respective analog or digital power-supply voltage limits.

# 10.3.3 Power-Supply Decoupling
Good power-supply decoupling is important to achieve optimum performance.
- APWR and AVDD must each be decoupled with a 1-µF capacitor to AGND.
- If APWR and AVDD are shorted together, a single 1-µF decoupling capacitor placed close to the AVDD pin is sufficient.
- DPWR and IOVDD must each be decoupled with a 1-µF capacitor to DGND.
- If DPWR and IOVDD are shorted together, a single 1-µF decoupling capacitor placed close to the IOVDD pin is sufficient.
- If APWR and DPWR are shorted together, a single 1-µF decoupling capacitor for the two supplies is sufficient.
- The DVDD LDO output at the DCAP pin must be decoupled with a 220-nF capacitor to DGND.

# 10.4 Layout

# 10.4.1 Layout Guidelines
For best performance, dedicate an entire PCB layer to a ground plane and do not route any other signal traces on this layer. However, depending on restrictions imposed by specific end equipment, a dedicated ground plane may not be practical. If ground plane separation is necessary, make a direct connection of the planes at the device. Do not connect individual ground planes at multiple locations because this configuration creates ground loops.
Route digital traces away from all analog inputs and associated components in order to minimize interference.
Use C0G capacitors on the analog inputs. Use ceramic capacitors (for example, X7R grade) for the power-supply decoupling capacitors. High-K capacitors (Y5V) are not recommended. Place the required capacitors as close as possible to the device pins using short, direct traces.
