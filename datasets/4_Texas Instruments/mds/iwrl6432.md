Remarks: 
The I2C pins SDA and SCL do not feature fail-safe I/O buffers. These pins could potentially draw current when the device is powered down.
The maximum th(SDA-SCLL) for I2C bus devices has only to be met if the device does not stretch the low period (tw(SCLL)) of the SCL signal.
Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF. If mixed with fast-mode devices, faster fall-times are allowed.

- A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (referred to the VIHmin of the SCL signal) to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.
- The ma# 8.15 I2C Timing Diagram
- A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (referred to the VIHmin of the SCL signal) to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.
- The maximum th(SDA-SCLL) has only to be met if the device does not stretch the LOW period (tw(SCLL)) of the SCL signal. E.A Fast-mode I2C-bus device can be used in a Standard-mode I2C-bus system, but the requirement tsu(SDA-SCLH) ≥ 250 ns must then be met. This will automatically be the case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such a device does stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal, it must output the next data bit to the SDA line tr max + tsu(SDA-SCLH).

# 9.3 Subsystems

# 9.3.1 RF and Analog Subsystem
The RF and analog subsystem includes the RF and analog circuitry – namely, the synthesizer, PA, LNA, mixer, IF, and ADC. This subsystem also includes the crystal oscillator and temperature sensors. The two TX can be operated simultaneously for beam forming in BPM mode or individually in TDM mode. Similarly, the device allows configuring the number of receive channels based on application and power requirements. For system power saving, RF and analog subsystems can be put into low power mode configuration.

# 9.3.2 Clock Subsystem
The IWRL6432 clock subsystem generates 57 to 64 GHz from an input reference from a crystal. It has a built-in oscillator circuit followed by a clean-up PLL and a RF synthesizer circuit. The output of the RF synthesizer is then processed by an X3 multiplier to create the required frequency in the 57 to 64 GHz spectrum. The RF synthesizer output is modulated by the timing engine block to create the required waveforms for effective sensor operation.
The clean-up PLL also provides a reference clock for the host processor after system wakeup.
The clock subsystem also has built-in mechanisms for detecting the presence of a crystal and monitoring the quality of the generated clock.
图 9-2 describes the clock subsystem.

ADVANCE INFORMATION

# 9.3.3 Transmit Subsystem
The IWRL6432 transmit subsystem consists of two parallel transmit chains, each with independent phase and amplitude control. The device supports binary phase modulation for MIMO radar, TX Beam forming application, and interference mitigation.
The transmit chains also support programmable backoff for system optimization.
图 9-3 describes the transmit subsystem.
图 9-3. Transmit Subsystem (Per Channel)

# 9.3.4 Receive Subsystem
The IWRL6432 receive subsystem consists of three parallel channels. A single receive channel consists of an LNA, mixer, IF filtering, ADC conversion, and decimation. All three receive channels can either operate simultaneously OR can be powered down individually based on system power needs and application design.
The IWRL6432 device supports a real baseband architecture, which uses real mixer, single IF and ADC chains to provide output for each receiver channel. The device is targeted for fast chirp systems. The band-pass IF chain has configurable lower cutoff frequencies above 175 kHz and can support bandwidths up to 5 MHz.

# 9.3.5 Processor Subsystem
图 9-5 shows the block diagram for customer programmable processor subsystems in the IWRL6432 device. At a high level there are two customer programmable subsystems, as shown separated by a dotted line in the diagram. The left hand side shows the HWA, a high-bandwidth interconnect for high performance (64-bit, 80MHz), and associated peripherals data transfer. RDIF interface for Measurement data output, L3 Radar data cube memory, the ADC buffers, the CRC engine, and data handshake memory (additional memory provided on interconnect).

ADVANCE INFORMATION

# 9.3.5.1 Main Subsystem
The right side of the diagram shows the Main Subsystem. The Main Subsystem is the brain of the device and controls all the device peripherals and house-keeping activities of the device. The Main Subsystem contains Cortex-M4F processor and associated peripherals and house-keeping components such as DMAs, CRC and Peripherals (I2C, UART, SPIs, CAN, PMIC clocking module, PWM, and others) connected to Main Interconnect through Peripheral Central Resource (PCR interconnect).
ADVANCE INFORMATION

# 9.3.6 Host Interface
The host interface can be provided through a SPI, UART, or CAN-FD interface. In some cases the serial interface for industrial applications is transcoded to a different serial standard.
The IWRL6432 device communicates with the host radar processor over the following main interfaces:
• Reference Clock – Reference clock available for host processor after device wakeup
• Control – 4-port standard SPI (peripheral) for host control. All radio control commands (and response) flow through this interface.
• Reset – Active-low reset for device wakeup from host.
• Host Interrupt - an indication that the mmWave sensor needs host interface
• Error – Used for notifying the host in case the radio controller detects a fault

# 9.3.7 Main Subsystem Cortex-M4F
The main system includes an ARM Cortex M4F processor clocked with a maximum operating frequency of 160 MHz. User applications executing on this processor control the overall operation of the device, including radar control through well-defined API messages, radar signal processing (assisted by the radar hardware accelerator), and peripherals for external interfaces.
See the Technical Reference Manual for a complete description and memory map.

# Other Subsystems

# GPADC Channels (Service) for User Application
The IWRL6432 device includes provision for an ADC service for user application, where the GPADC engine present inside the device can be used to measure up to two external voltages. The GPADC1, and GPADC2 pins are used for this purpose.
GPADC itself is controlled by TI firmware running inside the FEC subsystem and access to it for customer’s external voltage monitoring purpose is via ‘APPSS’ calls routed to the FEC subsystem. This API could be linked with the user application running on MSS M4F.
Device Firmware package (DFP) provides APIs to configure and measure these signals. The API allows configuring the settling time (number of ADC samples to skip) and number of consecutive samples to take. At the end of a frame, the minimum, maximum and average of the readings will be reported for each of the monitored voltages.

# 11 Device and Documentation Support
TI offers an extensive line of development tools. Tools and software to evaluate the performance of the device, generate code, and develop solutions follow.

# 11.1 Device Nomenclature
To designate the stages in the product development cycle, TI assigns prefixes to the part numbers of all microprocessors (MPUs) and support tools. Each device has one of three prefixes: X, P, or null (no prefix) (for example, IWRL6432). Texas Instruments recommends two of three possible prefix designators for its support tools: TMDX and TMDS. These prefixes represent evolutionary stages of product development from engineering prototypes (TMDX) through fully qualified production devices and tools (TMDS).
Device development evolutionary flow:
* X: Experimental device that is not necessarily representative of the final device's electrical specifications and may not use production assembly flow.
* P: Prototype device that is not necessarily the final silicon die and may not necessarily meet final electrical specifications.
* null: Production version of the silicon die that is fully qualified.
Support tool development evolutionary flow:
* TMDX: Development-support product that has not yet completed Texas Instruments internal qualification testing.
* TMDS: Fully-qualified development-support product.

This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD. Texas Instruments recommends that all integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures can cause damage.
ESD damage can range from subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage because very small parametric changes could cause the device not to meet its published specifications.
