# 7. Detailed Description

# 7.1 Overview
The LDC3114 is a hybrid multichannel, low-noise, high-resolution inductance-to-digital converter (LDC) optimized for inductive touch applications as well as linear position sensing. Button presses form micro-deflections in the conductive targets which cause frequency shifts in the resonant sensors. The LDC3114 can measure such frequency shifts and determine when button presses occur. With adjustable sensitivity per input channel, the LDC3114 can reliably operate with a wide range of physical button structures and materials. The high resolution measurement enables the implementation of force level buttons. The LDC3114 incorporates customizable post-processing algorithms for enhanced robustness.
The LDC3114 additionally implements a raw data access mode. The MCU can read directly the data representing the effective inductance of the sensor and implement further post processing. In this mode, additional post processing features such as baseline tracking and algorithms for false button detection are ignored. This mode is useful for linear or rotary position sensing with inductive sensors while having excellent EMI performance across wide range of applications. This mode can also be used to measure the micro-deflection for button-like applications as well.
The LDC3114 can operate in an ultra-low power mode for optimal battery life, or can be toggled into a higher scan rate for more responsive button press detection for game play or other low latency applications. The LDC3114 is operational from –40°C to +125°C with a 1.8 V ± 5% power supply voltage.
The LDC3114 is configured through 400-kHz I2C. Button presses can be reported through the I2C interface or with configurable polarity dedicated push-pull outputs. Besides the LC resonant sensors, the only external components necessary for operation are supply bypassing capacitors and a COM pin capacitor to ground.

Marker: (please refer to figure 7-1)

# 7.3 Feature Description

# 7.3.1 Multimode Operation
LDC3114 offers two main modes of operations: raw data access mode and button algorithm mode which is controlled by the BTN_ALG_EN field in Register INTPOL Address 0x11. 图 7-2 shows conceptually how these two modes are implemented.
Raw data access mode allows an external MCU to extract data from the signal after the inductance-to-digital converter from registers through I2C (see Raw Data Output). There is no further processing on this raw data such as baseline tracking, integrated button algorithms and button thresholding. This mode gives MCU full control over the measured raw data to implement algorithms for linear p# 7.3. Modes of Operations
Raw data access mode and button algorithm mode are the modes of operations. These are controlled by the BTN_ALG_EN field in Register INTPOL Address 0x11. 
Raw data access mode allows an external MCU to extract data from the signal after the inductance-to-digital converter from registers through I2C. There is no further processing on this raw data such as baseline tracking, integrated button algorithms and button thresholding. This mode gives MCU full control over the measured raw data to implement algorithms for linear position sensing, rotational encoder applications, metal presence/deflection applications, smart button algorithms and for multimodal sensor fusion applications.
The second mode is button algorithm mode. Here further processing with parameters defined by the user is done on the data and a button thresholding as defined by the user is applied. The processed data are available in separate registers to be read by I2C and any button press detection is indicated on the OUTx pins. This mode is used to implement button press functionality and can also be used to implement the measurement of force applied for button press along with detection to implement multilevel button press.
For register settings that are applicable to button mode versus raw access data mode are clearly identified in the descriptions of the registers.

# 7.3.2 Multichannel and Single-Channel Operation
The LDC3114 provides four independent sensing channels. In the following sections, some parameters, such as DATAn and SENSORn_CONFIG, contain a channel index n.
Any of the four channels available in the LDC3114 can be independently enabled by setting the ENn and LPENn (n = 0, 1, 2, or 3) bit fields in Register EN (Address 0x0C). The low-power-enable bit LPENn only takes effect if the corresponding ENn bit is also set. 
If only one channel is set active, the LDC3114 periodically samples the single active channel at the configured scan rate. When several channels are set active, the LDC3114 operates in multichannel mode, and the device sequentially samples the active channels at the configured scan rate. 
Each channel of the LDC3114 can be independently enabled in Low Power Mode and Normal Power Mode.

# 7.3.3 Raw Data Output
Raw data mode is enabled by setting BTN_ALG_EN=0x0 field in Register INTPOL Address 0x11. This operation will extract data directly from the output of the inductance-to-digital converter.
The data is read from the I2C interface of the LDC3114. The DATA_RDY field in Register OUT (Address 0x01) indicates when new data is available for reading. 
In the raw data mode, the INTB pin also assserted when new data is available and can be used by the MCU as an interrupt. The raw data can be extracted by reading, the output RAW_DATAn_x registers (n = 0, 1, 2, or 3, for each channel, x= 1, 2, or 3 splitting 24-bit data over 3 8-bit register fields). 

# Equation 
math
raw_data = \frac{f_{sensor}}{f_{REFCLK}}
where:
- `f_{sensor}` is the instantaneous frequency of the inductive sensor
- `f_{REFCLK}` is the internal reference clock frequency# 7.3.3 Raw Data Output Interface
New data is available for reading. In the raw data mode, the INTB pin also asserted when new data is available and can be used by the MCU as an interrupt. The raw data can be extracted by reading, the output RAW_DATAn_x registers (n = 0, 1, 2, or 3, for each channel, x= 1, 2, or 3 splitting 24-bit data over 3 8-bit register fields).

The LDC3114 features several algorithms that can mitigate false button detections due to mechanical non-idealities. The algorithms look for correlated button responses, such as similar or opposite responses between two neighboring buttons, to determine if there is any undesirable mechanical crosstalk. For more information, 
refer to Mitigating False Button Detections.

# 7.3.8 I2C Interface
The LDC3114 features an I2C Interface that can be used to program the internal registers and read channel data. Before reading the OUT (Address 0x01) or channel DATAn (n = 0, 1, 2 or 3, Addresses 0x02 through 0x09) registers for button press data or raw channel data, RAW_DATAn_x (n = 0, 1, 2, or 3, for each channel, x= 1, 2, or 3 splitting 24-bit data over 3 8-bit register fields), the user should always read Register STATUS (Address 0x00) first to lock the data. The LDC3114 supports burst mode with auto-incrementing register addresses. The LDC3114 has a fixed I2C address of 0x2A.

# 7.3.8.1 I2C Interface Specifications
The maximum speed of the I2C interface is 400 kHz. This sequence uses the standard I2C 7-bit target address followed by an 8-bit pointer to set the register address. For both write and read, the address pointer will auto-increment as long as the controller acknowledges.

# 7.3.8.2 I2C Bus Control
The LDC3114 cannot drive the I2C clock (SCL), that is the device does not support clock stretching. In the unlikely event where the SCL is stuck LOW, power cycle any device that is holding the SCL to activate its internal Power-On Reset (POR) circuit. If the LDC is connected to the same power supply as that device, there will be about 66-ms setup time before the LDC becomes active again. For more information, refer to Defining Power-On Timing. If the data line (SDA) is stuck LOW, the I2C controller should send nine clock pulses. The device that is holding the bus LOW should release the bus sometime within those nine clocks. If not, then power cycle to clear the bus. The LDC3114 has built-in monitors to check that the device is currently working. In the unlikely event of a device fault, the device state will be reset internally, and all the registers will be reset with default settings. For system robustness, TI recommends to check the value of a modified register periodically to monitor the device status and reload the register settings, if needed.

# 7.4 Device Functional Modes
The LDC3114 supports two power modes of operation: a Normal Power Mode for active sampling at 10, 20, 40, or 80 SPS, and a Low Power Mode for reduced current consumption at 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 SPS. The device can also be configured in Normal Power Mode for additional faster sampling rate of 160 SPS or for a continuous sampling rate. Refer to Configuring Button or Raw Data Scan Rate for details.

# 7.4.1 Normal Power Mode
When the LPWRB input pin is set to VDD, all enabled channels operate in Normal Power Mode. Each channel 
can be enabled independently through Register EN (Address 0x0C). For the electrical specification of Normal 
Power Mode Scan Rate, refer to the Electrical Characteristics table.

# 7.4.2 Low Power Mode
When the LPWRB input pin is set to ground, only the low-power-enabled channels are active. Each channel can 
be enabled independently to operate in Low Power Mode through Register EN (Address 0x0C). For a channel to 
operate in the Low Power Mode, both the LPENn and ENn bits (n is the channel index) must be set to 1. The 
Low Power Mode allows for energy-saving monitoring of button activity. In this mode, the device is in an inactive 
power-saving state for the majority of the time. Lower scan rates correspond to lower current consumption. In 
addition, the individual button sampling window should be set to the lowest effective setting (this is system 
dependent, but typically 0.8 ms to 1 ms). For the electrical specification of the configurable Low Power Mode 
Scan Rate, refer to the Electrical Characteristics table.

# 7.4.3 Configuration Mode
Before configuring any register settings, the device must be put into the configuration mode first. Setting 
CONFIG_MODE = 1 through Register RESET (Address 0x0A) stops data conversion and holds the device in 
configuration mode. Any device configuration changes can then be made. The current consumption in this mode 
is typically 0.3 mA. After all changes have been written, set CONFIG_MODE = 0 for normal operation. Refer to 
I2C Interface for more information.

# 8 Application and Implementation
Remark: The information in the following application section does not belong to the scope of TI device specifications, and TI does not guarantee its accuracy and completeness. TI's customers should be responsible for determining whether the device is suitable for their applications. Customers should verify and test their designs to ensure system functionality.

# 8.1 Application Information
The LDC3114 supports multiple buttons. Each button can be configured in various ways for optimal operation.

# 8.1.1 Theory of Operation
An AC current flowing through an inductor will generate an AC magnetic field. If a conductive material, such as a metal object, is in close proximity to the inductor, the magnetic field will induce circulating eddy currents on the surface of the conductor. The eddy currents are a function of the distance, size, and composition of the conductor. If the conductor is deflected toward the inductor as shown in 图 8-1, more eddy currents will be generated.
The eddy currents create their own magnetic field, which opposes the original field generated by the inductor. This effect reduces the effective inductance of the system, resulting in an increase in sensor frequency. 图 8-2 shows the inductance and frequency response of an example sensor with a diameter of 14 mm. As the sensitivity of an inductive sensor increases with closer targets, the conductive plate should be placed quite close to the sensor—typically 10% of the sensor diameter for circular coils. For rectangular or race-track-shaped coils, the target to sensor distance should typically be less than 10% of the shorter side of the coil.# 8.1.2. Designing Sensor Parameters
图 8-2 shows that each inductive touch button uses an LC resonator sensor, where L is the inductor, C is the capacitor, and RS is the AC series resistance of the sensor at the frequency of operation. The key parameters of the LC sensor include frequency, effective parallel resistance RP, and quality factor Q. These parameters must be within the ranges as specified in the Sensor section of the Electrical Characteristics table. Note that the effective RP and Q changes when the conductive target is in place.

---table end---

# 8.1.3. Setting COM Pin Capacitor
The COM pin requires a bypass capacitor to ground. The capacitor should be a low-ESL, low-ESR type. CCOM must be sized so that the following relationship is valid for all channels.
`100 × CSENSORn / QSENSORn < CCOM < 1250 × CSENSORn / QSENSORn`
The value of QSENSORn when the sensor is at the minimum target distance should be used. The maximum acceptable value for CCOM is 20 nF. The CCOM range for a particular sensor configuration can be obtained with the Spiral_Inductor_Designer tab of the LDC Calculations Tool.

# 8.1.4. Defining Power-On Timing
The low power architecture of the LDC3114 makes it possible for the device to be active all the time. When not being used, the LDC3114 can operate in Low Power Mode with a single standby power button, which typically consumes less than 10 µA. If additional power-saving is desired, or in the rare event where a power-on reset becomes necessary (see I2C Interface), the output data will become ready after 50-ms start-up time, about 1-ms optional register loading time, and two sampling windows for all active channels. 图 8-5 shows the power-on timing of the LDC3114.

# 8.1.5. Configuring Button
The output DATAn registers (Addresses 0x02 through 0x09) of the LDC3114 contain the processed values of the changes in sensor frequencies. The LC sensor frequency defined in 方程式 3 must be between 1 MHz and 30 MHz. For optimal performance, configure the sensor frequency to be greater than 3 MHz.
The sensor quality factor defined in 方程式 4 must be between 5 and 30. The series resistance defined in 方程式 5 can be represented as an equivalent parallel resistance, RP. RP can be viewed as the load on the sensor driver. This load corresponds to the current drive required to maintain the oscillation amplitude. RP must be between 350 Ω and 10 kΩ.
In summary, the LDC3114 requires that the sensor parameters are within the following ranges when the conductive target is present:
• 1 MHz ≤ f SENSOR ≤ 30 MHz
• 5 ≤ Q ≤ 30
• 350 Ω ≤ RP ≤ 10 kΩ# 8.1.4 Power-On Timing
In the rare event where a power-on reset becomes necessary (see I2C Interface), the output data will become ready after 50-ms start-up time, about 1-ms optional register loading time, and two sampling windows for all active channels. Figure 8-5 shows the power-on timing of the LDC3114.

# 8.1.5 Configuring Button or Raw Data Scan Rate
The LDC3114 periodically samples all active channels at the selected scan rate. The device can operate at eight different scan rates to meet various power consumption requirements, where a lower scan rate achieves lower power consumption.
In Normal Power Mode, the scan rate can be programmed to 80, 40, 20, or 10 SPS through Register NP_SCAN_RATE (Address 0x0D). Additionally through NPFSR bit field in the same register 160 SPS rate can be enabled which overrides the setting of NPSR but not the NPCS bit fields. The NPCS bit field allows to set the part in continuous sampling mode in Normal Power Mode only. When NPCS is set then the settings for NPSR and NPFSR are ignored.
In Low Power Mode, the scan rate can be programmed to 5, 2.5, 1.25, or 0.625 SPS through Register LP_SCAN_RATE (Address 0x0F). The mode is selected by setting the LPWRB pin to VDD (Normal Power) or ground (Low Power). In either mode, each button can be independently enabled through a bit in Register EN (Address 0x0C).

# 8.1.6 Programming Button or Raw Data Sampling Window
The sampling window is the actual duration per scan cycle for active data sampling of the sensor frequency. It is programmed with the exponential parameter, LCDIV, in Register LC_DIVIDER (Address 0x17), and the individual linear sensor cycle counter SENCYCn (n = 0, 1, 2, or 3) in Registers SENSORn_CONFIG (n = 0, 1, 2, or 3, Addresses 0x20, 0x22, 0x24, 0x26). For most touch button applications, the button sampling window should be set to between 1 ms and 8 ms. For sampling rate of 160 SPS, the window has to be less than 6.25 ms. For continuous sampling, the data becomes available at the configured sampling window period rate. The recommended minimum sensor conversion time is 1 ms. Longer conversion time can be used to achieve better signal-to-noise ratio, if needed. The active channels in figure 8-6 will sample sequentially if multiple channels are enabled.# 8.1.7 Scaling Frequency Counter Output
The LDC3114 requires this internal frequency counter scaler to be set based on the button sampling window to avoid data overflow. Use 方程式 8 to set the scaler in Register CNTSC (Address 0x1E):

# 8.1.8 Setting Button Triggering Threshold
Every material shows some hysteresis when the material deforms then returns to the original state. The amount of hysteresis is a function of material properties and physical parameters, such as size and thickness. This feature modifies the hysteresis of the button signal threshold according to different materials and various button shapes and sizes. Hysteresis can be programmed in Register HYST (Address 0x18). By default, the button triggering hysteresis is set to 32. The nominal button triggering threshold is 128. With hysteresis, the effective on-threshold is 128 + 32 = 160. This means if the DATAn (n = 0, 1, 2, or 3) reaches 160, the LDC3114 considers that as a button press. When the DATAn decreases to 128 – 32 = 96, the LDC considers the button to be released.

# 8.1.10 Mitigating False Button Detections
The LDC3114 offers several algorithms that can mitigate false button detections due to mechanical non-idealities associated with groups of buttons. These are listed below.

# 8.1.10.1 Eliminating Common-Mode Change (Anti-Common)
This algorithm eliminates false detection when a user presses the middle of two or more buttons, which could lead to a common-mode response on multiple buttons. All the buttons can be individually enabled to have this feature by programming Register COMMON_DEFORM (Address 0x1A).

# 8.1.10.2 Resolving Simultaneous Button Presses (Max-Win)
This algorithm enables the system to select the button pressed with maximum force when multiple buttons are pressed at the same time. This could happen when two buttons are physically very close to each other, and pressing one causes a residual reaction on the other. Buttons can be individually enabled to join the “max-win” group by configuring Register BTPAUSE_MAXWIN (Address 0x16).

# 8.1.10.3 Overcoming Case Twisting (Anti-Twist)
The anti-twist algorithm reduces the likelihood of false detection when the case is twisted, which could cause unintended mechanical activation of the buttons, or an opposite reaction in two adjacent buttons. When this algorithm is enabled, detection of button presses is suppressed if any button’s output data is negative by a configurable threshold. The anti-twist algorithm can be enabled by configuring Register TWIST (Address 0x19).

# 8.1.10.4 Mitigating Metal Deformation (Anti-Deform)
This function filters changes due to metal deformation in the vicinity of one or more buttons. Such metal deformation can be accidentally caused by pressing a neighboring button that does not have sufficient mechanical isolation. The user can specify which buttons to join the anti-deform group by configuring Register COMMON_DEFORM (Address 0x1A).

# 8.1.11 Reporting Interrupts for Button Presses, Raw Data Ready and Error Conditions
INTB, the LDC3114 interrupt pin, is asserted when a button press or an error condition occurs. The default polarity is active low and can be configured through Register INTPOL (Address 0x11).
Illustration of the LDC3114 response to a single button press on Channel 0. At the end of the button sampling window following a press of Button 0, the OUT0 pin and INTB pin are asserted. The OUT_STATUS bit changes from 0 to 1, and remains so until a read of the STATUS register clears it. The OUTn (n = 0, 1, 2, or 3) and INTB pins are asserted until the end of the button sampling window following the release of the button.# 8.1.12 Estimating Supply Current
When the LDC3114 is active (in either Normal Power Mode or Low Power Mode), use Equation 15 to determine the current: 
math
n n n f ACTIVE SENSOR 1.21 P 12 I 1.6 0.011 1 16 R
where 
- IACTIVEn is the supply current in mA during active sampling 
- RPn is the sensor parallel resonant impedance in kΩ 
- f SENSORn is the sensor frequency in MHz 
- n is the channel index, that is, n = 0, 1, 2, or 3 for LDC3114
The LDC3114 is only actively sampling the enabled channels during a fraction of the scan window. Equation 16 determines the average supply current: 
math
n n n t t DD ACTIVE SAMPLE SCAN 1 I I 0.005
where 
- IDD is the average supply current in mA 
- t SCAN is the scan window (set by the scan rate) in ms 
- IACTIVEn is the supply current when the device is active as defined by Equation 15 
- t SAMPLE is the button sampling window in ms

# 8.2 Typical Application

# 8.2.1 Touch Button Design
The low power architecture of LDC3114 makes them suitable for driving button sensors in consumer electronics, such as mobile phones. Most mobile phones today have three buttons along the edges, namely the power button, volume up, and volume down.
On a typical smartphone, the two volume buttons are next to each other, so they may be susceptible to false detections such as simultaneous button presses. To prevent such mis-triggers, they can be grouped together to take advantage of the various features that mitigate false detections as explained in Mitigating False Button Detections. For example, if Max-win is applied to the two volume buttons...# 8.2.1 Design Requirements
The sensor parameters, including frequency, RP, and Q factor have to be within the design space of the LDC3114 as specified in the Electrical Characteristics table.

# 8.2.1.2 Detailed Design Procedure
The LDC3114 is a multichannel device. The italic n in the parameters below refers to the channel index:
1. Select system-based options:
   * Select Normal or Low Power Mode of operation by setting the LPWRB pin to VDD or ground, respectively. Configure the enable bits for all channels in Register EN (Address 0x0C).
   * Select the polarities of OUTn and INTB pins by configuring Register OPOL_DPOL (Address 0x1C) and Register INTPOL (Address 0x11).
   * Configure the sensor frequency setting in Registers SENSORn_CONFIG (Addresses 0x20, 0x22, 0x24, 0x26).
2. Choose the sampling rate (80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, or 0.625 SPS) based on system power consumption requirement, and configure Register NP_SCAN_RATE (Address 0x0D) or Register LP_SCAN_RATE (Address 0x0F).
3. Choose the button sampling window based on power consumption and noise requirements (recommended: 1 ms to 8 ms). While a longer button sampling window provides better noise performance, 1 ms is typically sufficient for most applications. Set SENCYCn and LCDIV in Registers SENSORn_CONFIG (Addresses 0x20, 0x22, 0x24, 0x26) and Register LC_DIVIDER (Address 0x17) in the following steps:
   * Calculate LCDIV = ceiling (log2 (f SENSORn × t SAMPLEn) – 12), where f SENSORn is the sensor frequency in MHz, t SAMPLEn is the button sampling window in µs.
   * If LCDIV < 0, set it to 0.
   * Adjust SENCYCn to get desired t SAMPLEn according to t SAMPLEn = 128 × (SENCYCn + 1) × 2LCDIV / f SENSORn.
4. Calibrate gain in the appropriate Registers GAINn (Addresses 0x0E, 0x10, 0x12, 0x14). The gain setting can be used to tune the sensitivity of the touch button. GAINn is a 6-bit field with 64 different gain levels corresponding to normalized gains between 1 and 232. A good mechanical and sensor design typically requires a gain level of around 32 to 50, corresponding to relative gains of 16 to 76 (normalized to gain level of 0). Use the following sequence to determine the appropriate gain for each button:
   * Apply minimum desired force to the button.
   * Read initial DATAn value after the button press. Note that the baseline tracking will affect this value.
   * Calculate gain factor required to increase DATAn to the programmed threshold (default is 160).
   * Look up the Gain Table to find the required gain setting.
5. Enable special features to mitigate button interferen# 8.2.1.3 Application Curves
图 8-16 shows a sequence of button presses of 150 grams force, two presses to Channel 0, then two presses to Channel 1. Each button press response is greater than the threshold.

# 9 Power Supply Recommendations
The LDC3114 power supply should be bypassed with a 1-µF and a 0.1-µF pair of capacitors in parallel to ground. The capacitors should be placed as close to the LDC as possible. The smaller value 0.1-µF capacitor should be placed closer to the VDD pin than the 1-µF capacitor. The capacitors should be a low-ESL, low-ESR type.
Refer to Recommended Operating Conditions for more details.

The COM pin must be bypassed to ground with an appropriate value capacitor. For details of how to choose the capacitor value, refer to Setting COM Pin Capacitor. CCOM should be placed as close as possible to the COM pin. The COM signal should be tied to a small copper fill placed underneath the INn signals. The INn signals should stay clear of other high frequency traces.
Each active channel needs to have an LC resonator connected to the corresponding INn pins. The sensor capacitor should be placed within 10 mm of the corresponding INn pin, and the inductor should be placed at the appropriate location next to (but not touching) the metal target. The INn traces should be at least 6 mil (0.15 mm) wide to minimize parasitic inductances.
