# 8 Parameter Measurement Information

# 8.1 Switching Parameters
图 8-1 shows the circuit used to measure most switching parameters. The top device in this circuit is used to re-circulate the inductor current and functions in third-quadrant mode only. Only the LMG3422R050 must be used as the top device as it does not have the ideal-diode mode feature. Do not use the LMG3425R050 for the top device. If the top device has the ideal-diode mode feature, it will automatically turn on the GaN FET when the inductor current is re-circulating and cause a shoot-through current event when the bottom device turns on. The bottom device is the active device that turns on to increase the inductor current to the desired test current. The bottom device is then turned off and on to create switching waveforms at a specific inductor current. Both the drain current (at the source) and the drain-source voltage is measured. 图 8-2 shows the specific timing measurement. TI recommends to use the half-bridge as double pulse tester. Excessive third-quadrant operation can overheat the top device.

# 8.1.1 Turn-On Times
The turn-on transition has three timing components: drain-current turn-on delay time, turn-on delay time, and 
turn-on rise time. The drain-current turn-on delay time is from when IN goes high to when the GaN FET drain-
current reaches 1 A. The turn-on delay time is from when IN goes high to when the drain-source voltage falls 
20% below the bus voltage. Finally, the turn-on rise time is from when drain-source voltage falls 20% below the 
bus voltage to when the drain-source voltage falls 80% below the bus voltage. Note that the turn-on rise time is 
the same as the VDS 80% to 20% fall time. All three turn-on timing components are a function of the RDRV pin 
setting.

# 8.1.2 Turn-Off Times
The turn-off transition has two timing components: turn..# 8.1.2 Turn-Off Times
The turn-off transition has two timing components: turn-off delay time, and turn-off fall time. The turn-off delay 
time is from when IN goes low to when the drain-source voltage rises to 20% of the bus voltage. The turn-off fall 
time is from when the drain-source voltage rises to 20% of the bus voltage to when the drain-source voltage 
rises to 80% of the bus voltage. Note that the turn-off fall time is the same as the VDS 20% to 80% rise time. The 
turn-off timing components are independent of the RDRV pin setting, but heavily dependent on the LHB load 
current.

# 8.1.3 Drain-Source Turn-On Slew Rate
The drain-source turn-on slew rate, measured in volts per nanosecond, is the inverse of the turn-on rise time or 
equivalently the inverse of the VDS 80% to 20% fall time. The RDRV pin is used to program the slew rate.

# 8.1.4 Turn-On and Turn-Off Switching Energy
The turn-on and turn-off switching energy shown in 图 7-11 represent the energy absorbed by the low-side 
device during the turn-on and turn-off transients of the circuit. As the circuit in 图 8-1 represents a boost 
converter with input shorted to output, the switching energy is dissipated in the low-side device. The turn-on 
transition is lossy while the turn-off transition is essentially lossless with the output capacitance energy charged 
by the inductor current. The turn-on and turn-off losses have been calculated from experimental waveforms by 
integrating the product of the drain current with the drain-source voltage over the turn-on and turn-off times, 
respectively. The skew of probes for voltage and current are very important for accurate measurement of turn-on 
and turn-off energy.

# 9 Detailed Description

# 9.1 Overview
The LMG342xR050 is a high-performance power GaN device with integrated gate driver. The GaN device offers 
zero reverse recovery and ultra-low output capacitance, which enables high efficiency in bridge-based 
topologies. Direct Drive architecture is applied to control the GaN device directly by the integrated gate driver. 
This architecture provides superior switching performance compared to the traditional cascode approach and 
helps solve a number of challenges in GaN applications.
The integrated driver ensures the device stays off for high drain slew rates. The integrated driver also protects 
the GaN device from overcurrent, short-circuit, undervoltage, and overtemperature. Regarding fault signal 
reporting, LMG342xR050 provides different reporting method which is shown in 表 9-1. Refer to Fault Detection 
for more details. The integrated driver is also able to sense the die temperature and send out the temperature 
signal through a modulated PWM signal.
Unlike Si MOSFETs, GaN devices do not have a p-n junction from source to drain and thus have no reverse 
recovery charge. However, GaN devices still conduct from source to drain similar to a p-n junction body diode, 
but with higher voltage drop and higher conduction loss. Therefore, source-to-drain conduction time must be 
minimized while the LMG342xR050 GaN FET is turned on.# 9.

The ideal-diode mode feature in the LMG3425R050 automatically minimizes the source-to-drain conduction loss that occur on the GaN FET soft-switched turn-on edge, similar to optimum dead-time control.

# 9.3 Feature Description 
The LMG342xR050 includes advanced features to provide superior switching performance and converter efficiency. 

# 9.3.1 GaN FET Operation Definitions 
For the purposes of this data sheet, the following terms are defined below. The SOURCE pin is assumed to be at 0 V for these definitions.
- First-Quadrant Current = Positive current flowing internally from the DRAIN pin to the SOURCE pin.
- Third-Quadrant Current = Positive current flowing internally from the SOURCE pin to the DRAIN pin.
- First-Quadrant Voltage = Drain pin voltage – Source pin voltage = Drain pin voltage
- Third-Quadrant Voltage = SOURCE pin voltage – DRAIN pin voltage = –DRAIN pin voltage
- FET On-State = FET channel is at rated RDS(on). Both first-quadrant current and third-quadrant current can flow at rated RDS(on).
For LMG342xR050 in On-State, GaN FET internal gate voltage is held at the SOURCE pin voltage to achieve rated RDS(on). The GaN FET channel is at rated RDS(on) with VGS = 0 V because the LMG342xR050 GaN FET is a depletion mode FET. FET Off-State = FET channel is fully off for positive first-quadrant voltage. No first-quadrant current can flow. While first-quadrant current cannot flow in the FET Off-State, third-quadrant current still flows if the DRAIN voltage is taken sufficiently negative (positive third-quadrant voltage). For devices with an intrinsic p-n junction body diode, current flow begins when the DRAIN voltage drops enough to forward bias the p-n junction. 
GaN FETS do not have an intrinsic p-n junction body diode. Instead, current flows because the GaN FET channel turns back on. In this case, the DRAIN pin becomes the electrical source and the SOURCE pin becomes the electrical drain. To enhance the channel in third-quadrant, the DRAIN (electrical source) voltage must be taken sufficiently low to establish a VGS voltage greater than the GaN FET threshold voltage. The GaN FET channel is operating in saturation and only turns on enough to support the third-quadrant current as its saturated current. 
For LMG342xR050 in Off-State, GaN FET internal gate voltage is held at the VNEG pin voltage to block all first-quadrant current. The VNEG voltage is lower than the GaN FET negative threshold voltage to cut off the channel. 
To enhance the channel in off-state third quadrant, the LMG342xR050 DRAIN (electrical source) voltage must be taken sufficiently close to VNEG to establish a VGS voltage greater than the GaN FET threshold voltage.

# 9.3.2 Direct-Drive GaN Architecture
The LMG342xR050 uses a series Si FET to ensure the power IC stays off when VDD bias power is not applied. When the VDD bias power is off, the series Si FET is interconnected with the GaN device in a cascode mode, which is shown in the Functional Block Diagram. The gate of the GaN device is held within a volt of the series Si FET's source. When a high voltage is applied on the module and the silicon FET blocks the drain voltage, the VGS of the GaN device decreases until the GaN device passes the threshold voltage. Then, the GaN device is turned off and blocks the remaining major part of drain voltage. There is an internal clamp to make sure that the VDS does not exceed its maximum rating. This feature avoids the avalanche of the series Si FET when there is no bias power.
When LMG342xR050 is powered up with VDD bias power, the internal buck boost converter generates a negative voltage (VVNEG) that is sufficient to directly turn off the GaN device. In this case, the series Si FET is held on and the GaN device is gated directly with the negative voltage.
Comparing with traditional cascode drive GaN architecture, where the GaN gate is grounded and the Si MOSFET gate is being driven to control the GaN device, direct-drive configuration has multiple advantages. First, as the Si MOSFET does need to switch in every switching cycle, GaN gate-to-source charge (QGS) is lower and there’s no Si MOSFET reverse-recovery related losses. Second, the voltage distribution between the GaN and Si MOSFET in off-mode in a cascode configuration can cause the MOSFET to avalanche due to high GaN drain-to-source capacitance (CDS). Finally, the switching slew rate in direct-drive configuration can be controlled while cascode drive cannot. More information about the direct-drive GaN architecture can be found in Direct-drive configuration for GaN devices.

# 9.3.3 Drain-Source Voltage Capability
Due to the silicon FET’s long reign as the dominant power-switch technology, many designers are unaware that the headline drain-source voltage cannot be used as an equivalent point to compare devices across technologies. The headline drain-source voltage of a silicon FET is set by the avalanche breakdown voltage. The headline drain-source voltage of a GaN FET is set by the long term reliability with respect to data sheet specifications.
Exceeding the headline drain-source volt# 9.3.3 Drain-Source Voltage Capability
Due to the silicon FET’s long reign as the dominant power-switch technology, many designers are unaware that the headline drain-source voltage cannot be used as an equivalent point to compare devices across technologies. The headline drain-source voltage of a silicon FET is set by the avalanche breakdown voltage. The headline drain-source voltage of a GaN FET is set by the long term reliability with respect to data sheet specifications.
Exceeding the headline drain-source voltage of a silicon FET can lead to immediate and permanent damage. Meanwhile, the breakdown voltage of a GaN FET is much higher than the headline drain-source voltage. For example, the breakdown voltage of the LMG342xR050 is more than 800 V.
A silicon FET is usually the weakest link in a power application during an input voltage surge. Surge protection circuits must be carefully designed to ensure the silicon FET avalanche capability is not exceeded because it is not feasible to clamp the surge below the silicon FET breakdown voltage. Meanwhile, it is easy to clamp the surge voltage below a GaN FET breakdown voltage. In fact, a GaN FET can continue switching during the surge event which means output power is safe from interruption.
The LMG342xR050 drain-source capability is explained with the assistance of 图 9-1. The figure shows the drain-source voltage versus time for a GaN FET for a single switch cycle in a switching application. No claim is made about the switching frequency or duty cycle.

# 9.3.4 Internal Buck-Boost DC-DC Converter
An internal inverting buck-boost converter generates a regulated negative rail for the turn-off supply of the GaN device. The buck-boost converter is controlled by a peak current mode, hysteretic controller. In normal operation, the converter remains in discontinuous-conduction mode, but can enter continuous-conduction mode during start-up and overload the conditions. The converter is controlled internally and requires only a single surface-mount inductor and output bypass capacitor. Typically, the converter is designed to use a 4.7 μH inductor and a 2.2 μF output capacitor.
The buck-boost converter uses a peak current hysteretic control.# 9.3.4 Buck-Boost Converter
erates a regulated negative rail for the turn-off supply of the GaN 
device. The buck-boost converter is controlled by a peak current mode, hysteretic controller. In normal operation, 
the converter remains in discontinuous-conduction mode, but can enter continuous-conduction mode during 
start-up and overload the conditions. The converter is controlled internally and requires only a single surface-
mount inductor and output bypass capacitor. Typically, the converter is designed to use a 4.7 μH inductor and a 
2.2 μF output capacitor.
The buck-boost converter uses a peak current hysteretic control. As shown in Figure 9-2, the inductor current 
increases at the beginning of a switching cycle until the inductor reaches the peak current limit. Then the 
inductor current goes down to zero. The idle time between each current pulse is determined automatically by the 
output current, and can be reduced to zero. Therefore, the maximum output current happens when the idle time 
is zero, and is decided by the peak current but to a first order is independent of the inductor value. However, the 
peak output current the buck-boost can deliver to the -14V rail is proportional to the VDD input voltage. 
Therefore, the maximum switching frequency of the GaN that the buck-boost can support varies with VDD 
voltage and is only specified for operation up to 3.6 MHz for VDD voltages above 9V.

# 9.3.5 VDD Bias Supply
Wide VDD voltage ranges from 7.5 V to 18 V are supported by internal regulators which supply the bias supplies 
needed for the internal circuits to function. TI recommends to use a 12-V unregulated power supply to supply 
VDD.

# 9.3.6 Auxiliary LDO
There is a 5-V voltage regulator inside the part used to supply external loads, such as digital isolators for the 
high-side drive signal. The digital outputs of the part use this rail as their supply. No capacitor is required for 
stability, but transient response is poor if no external capacitor is provided. If the application uses this rail to 
supply external circuits, TI recommends to have a capacitor of at least 0.1 μF for improved transient response. 
A larger capacitor can be used for further transient response improvement. The decoupling capacitor used here 
must be a low-ESR ceramic type. Capacitances above 0.47 μF will slow down the start-up time of the 
LMG342xR050 due to the ramp-up time of the 5-V rail.

# 9.3.7 Fault Detection
The GaN power IC integrates overcurrent protection (OCP), short-circuit protection (SCP), overtemperature 
protection (OTP) and undervoltage lockout (UVLO).

# 9.3.7.1 Overcurrent Protection and Short-Circuit Protection
There are two types of current faults which can be detected by the driver: overcurrent fault and short-circuit fault.
The overcurrent protection (OCP) circuit monitors drain current and compares that current signal with an 
internally set limit IT(OC). Upon detection of the overcurrent, the LMG342xR050 conducts cycle-by-cycle 
overcurrent protection as shown in 图 9-4. In this mode, the GaN device is shut off and the OC pin is pulled low 
when the drain current crosses the IT(OC) plus a delay toff(OC), but the overcurrent signal clears after the IN pin 
signal goes low. In the next cycle, the GaN device can turn on as normal. The cycle-by-cycle function can be 
used in cases where steady-state operation current is below the OCP level but transient response can still reach 
current limit, while the circuit operation cannot be paused. The cycle-by-cycle function also prevents the GaN 
device from overheating by overcurrent induced conduction losses.
The short circuit protection (SCP) monitors the drain current and triggers if the di/dt of the current exceeds a 
threshold di/dt T(SC) as the current crosses between the OC and SC thresholds. It performs this di/dt detection by 
delaying the OC detection signal by an amount tOC,window and using a higher current SC detection threshold. If 
the delayed OC occurs before the non-delayed SC, the di/dt is below the threshold and an OC is triggered. If the 
SC is detected first, the di/dt is fast enough and the SC is detected as shown in 图 9-5. This extremely high di/dt 
current would typically be caused by a short of the output of the half-bridge and can be damaging for the GaN to 
continue to operate in that condition. Therefore, if a short-circuit fault is detected, the GaN device is turned off 
with an intentionally slowed driver so that a lower overshoot voltage and ringing can be achieved during the turn-
off event. This fast response circuit helps protect the GaN device even under a hard short-circuit condition. In 
this protection, the GaN device is shut off and held off until the fault is reset by either holding the IN pin low for a 
period of time defined in th# 1. Introduction to GaN 
ld typically be caused by a short of the output of the half-bridge and can be damaging for the GaN to 
continue to operate in that condition. Therefore, if a short-circuit fault is detected, the GaN device is turned off 
with an intentionally slowed driver so that a lower overshoot voltage and ringing can be achieved during the turn-

this protection, the GaN device is shut off and held off until the fault is reset by either holding the IN pin low for a 
period of time defined in the Specifications or removing power from VDD.

# 2. Overcurrent Protection in GaN
During OCP or SCP in a half bridge, after the current reaches the upper limit and the device is turned off by 
protection, the PWM input of the device could still be high and the PWM input of the complementary device 
could still be low. In this case, the load current can flow through the third quadrant of the complementary device 
with no synchronous rectification. The high negative VDS of the GaN device (–3 V to –5 V) from drain to source 
could lead to high third-quadrant loss, similar to dead-time loss but for a longer time.

# 3. Safety Considerations for GaN
For safety considerations, OCP allows cycle-by-cycle operation while SCP latches the device until reset. By 
reading the FAULT and OC pins, the exact current fault type can be determined. Refer to Fault Reporting for 
detailed information.

# 4. Overtemperature Shutdown in GaN
The LMG342xR050 implements two overtemperature-shutdown (OTSD) functions, the GaN OTSD and the 
Driver OTSD. Two OTSD functions are needed to maximize device protection by sensing different locations in 
the device and protecting against different thermal-fault scenarios.

# 5. GaN FET Operation Definitions
The GaN OTSD senses the GaN FET temperature. The GaN FET can overheat from both first-quadrant current 
and third-quadrant current. As explained in GaN FET Operation Definitions, a FET can prevent first-quadrant 
current by going into the off-state but is unable to prevent third-quadrant current. FET third-quadrant losses are a 
function of the FET technology, current magnitude, and if the FET is operating in the on-state or off-state. As 
explained in GaN FET Operation Definitions, the LMG342xR050 has much higher GaN FET third-quadrant 
losses in the off-state.

# 6. Overtemperature-Shutdown Ideal-Diode Mode Operation
When the GaN FET is too hot, the best protection is to turn off the GaN FET when first-quadrant current tries to 
flow and turn on the GaN FET when third-quadrant current is flowing. This type of FET control is known as ideal-
diode mode (IDM). When the GaN OTSD trip point is exceeded, the GaN OTSD puts the GaN FET into 
overtemperature-shutdown ideal-diode mode (OTSD-IDM) operation to achieve this optimum protection. OTSD-
IDM is explained in Ideal-Diode Mode Operation.

# 7. Driver OTSD
The Driver OTSD senses the integrated driver temperature and trips at a higher temperature compared to the 
GaN OTSD. This second OTSD function exists to protect the LMG342xR050 from driver thermal-fault events 
while allowing sufficient temperature difference for OTSD-IDM to operate. These driver thermal events include 
shorts on the LDO5V, BBSW, and VNEG device pins. When the Driver OTSD trip point is exceeded, the Driver 
OTSD shuts off the LDO5V regulator, the VNEG buck-boost converter, and the GaN FET. Note that OTSD-IDM 
does not function in Driver OTSD. This is why the Driver OTSD must trip higher# 9.3.7.2 Driver OTSD
OTSD senses the integrated driver temperature and trips at a higher temperature compared to the GaN OTSD. This second OTSD function exists to protect the LMG342xR050 from driver thermal-fault events while allowing sufficient temperature difference for OTSD-IDM to operate. These driver thermal events include shorts on the LDO5V, BBSW, and VNEG device pins. When the Driver OTSD trip point is exceeded, the Driver OTSD shuts off the LDO5V regulator, the VNEG buck-boost converter, and the GaN FET. Note that OTSD-IDM does not function in Driver OTSD. This is why the Driver OTSD must trip higher than the GaN OTSD function. Otherwise, GaN FET third-quadrant overheating cannot be addressed.
Besides the temperature difference in the GaN OTSD and Driver OTSD trip points, further temperature separation is obtained due to the thermal gradient difference between the GaN OTSD and Driver OTSD sense points. The GaN OTSD sensor is typically at least 20°C hotter than the driver OTSD sensor when the device is in GaN OTSD due to GaN FET power dissipation.
The FAULT pin is asserted for either or both the GaN OTSD state and the Driver OTSD state. FAULT de-asserts and the device automatically returns to normal operation after both the GaN OTSD and Driver OTSD fall below their negative-going trip points. During cool down, when the device exits the Driver OTSD state but is still in the GaN OTSD state, the device automatically resumes OTSD-IDM operation.

# 9.3.7.3 UVLO Protection
The LMG342xR050 supports a wide range of VDD voltages. However, when the device is below UVLO threshold, the GaN device stops switching and is held off. The FAULT pin is pulled low as an indication of UVLO. The LDO and buck-boost are turned on by the rising-edge of the VIN UVLO and shuts off around 5 V to 6 V.

# 9.3.7.4 Fault Reporting
The FAULT and OC outputs form a fault reporting scheme together. The FAULT and OC outputs are both push-pull outputs indicating the readiness and fault status of the driver. These two pins are logic high in normal operation, and change logic according to
---table begin---
Table tile: Fault Types and Reporting
| NORMAL | UVLO, OT, and RDRV-OPEN | OVERCURRENT | SHORT-CIRCUIT |
|---|---|---|---|
| FAULT | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| OC | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
---table end---
FAULT is held low when starting up until the series Si FET is turned on. During operation, if the power supplies go below the UVLO thresholds or the device temperature go above the OT thresholds, power device is disabled and FAULT is held low until a fault condition is no longer detected. If RDRV is open, FAULT is also held low. In a short-circuit or overtemperature fault condition, FAULT is held low until the fault latches are reset or fault is cleared. The OC pin is held low if there is a short-circuit or overcurrent fault. The signals help notify the controller the exact type of faults by reading the truth table. If a combined reporting of the faults on a single pin is desired, one can short the OC pin to ground during power up. All faults assert the FAULT pin then and the OC pin is not used. Please note: internal protection happens regardless of the connection of the pin outputs, which means that the protection features continue to operate even if fault reporting is ignored.

# 9.3.8 Drive Strength Adjustment
The LMG342xR050 allows users to adjust the drive strength of the device and obtain a desired slew rate, which provides flexibility when optimizing switching losses and noise coupling. To adjust drive strength, a resistor can be placed between the RDRV pin and GND pin. The resistance determines the slew rate of the device, from 20 V/ns to 150 V/ns, during t# 9.3.8 Drive Strength Adjustment
The LMG342xR050 allows users to adjust the drive strength of the device and obtain a desired slew rate, which provides flexibility when optimizing switching losses and noise coupling. To adjust drive strength, a resistor can be placed between the RDRV pin and GND pin. The resistance determines the slew rate of the device, from 20 V/ns to 150 V/ns, during turn-on. On the other hand, there are two dv/dt values that can be selected without the resistor: shorting the RDRV pin to ground sets the slew rate to 150 V/ns, and shorting the RDRV pin to LDO5V sets the slew rate to 100 V/ns. The device detects the short to LDO5V one time at power up. Once the short to LDO5V condition is detected, the device no longer monitors the RDRV pin. Otherwise, the RDRV pin is continuously monitored and the dv/dt setting can be changed by modulating the resistance during device operation. The modulation must be fairly slow since there is significant internal filtering to reject switching noise. Please note: parasitic power loop inductance can influence the voltage slew rate reading from the VDS switching waveform.The inductance induces a drop on VDS in the current rising phase before voltage falling phase, if this drop is more than 20% of the VDC, the voltage slew rate reading can be influenced. Refer to 节 12.1.2 for the power loop design guideline and how to estimate the parasitic power loop inductance.

# 9.3.9 Temperature-Sensing Output
The integrated driver senses the GaN die temperature and outputs the information through a modulated PWM signal on the TEMP pin. The typical PWM frequency is 9 kHz with the same refresh rate. The minimum PWM duty cycle is around 1%, which can be observed at temperature below 25 C. The target temperature range is from 25°C to 150°C, and the corresponding PWM duty cycle is typically from 3% to 82%. Following equation can be used to calculate the typical junction temperature TJ,typ in °C from the duty cycle DTEMP: TJ,typ (°C) = 162.3 * DTEMP + 20.1. The tolerances of typical measurement are listed in 表 9-2.
---table begin---
Table tile: 表 9-2 Typical Junction Temperature Measurement based on TEMP Signal and Tolerance
| Typical TJ Measurement based on TEMP Signal (°C) | Tolerance (°C) |
|---|---|
| 25 | ± 5 |
| 85 | ± 6 |
| 125 | ± 10 |
---table end---
At temperatures above 150°C, the duty cycle continues to increase linearly until overtemperature fault happens. When overtemperature happens, the TEMP pin is pulled high to indicate this fault until the temperature is reduced to the normal range. There is a hysteresis to clear overtemperature fault.

# 9.3.10 Ideal-Diode Mode Operation
Off-state FETs act like diodes by blocking current in one direction (first quadrant) and allowing current in the other direction (third quadrant) with a corresponding diode like voltage drop. FETs, though, can also conduct third-quadrant current in the on-state at a significantly lower voltage drop. Ideal-diode mode (IDM) is when an FET is controlled to block first-quadrant current by going to the off-state and conduct third-quadrant current by going to the on-state, thus achieving an ideal lower voltage drop. FET off-state third-quadrant current flow is commonly seen in power converters, both in normal and fault situations. As explained in GaN FET Operation Definitions, GaN FETs do not have an intrinsic p-n junction body diode to conduct off-state third-quadrant current.# 1. Introduction
FETs can also conduct third-quadrant current in the on-state at a significantly lower voltage drop. Ideal-diode mode (IDM) is when an FET is controlled to block first-quadrant current by going to the off-state and conduct third-quadrant current by going to the on-state, thus achieving an ideal lower voltage drop. FET off-state third-quadrant current flow is commonly seen in power converters, both in normal and fault situations.

# 2. GaN FET Operation Definitions
As explained in GaN FET Operation Definitions, GaN FETs do not have an intrinsic p-n junction body diode to conduct off-state third-quadrant current. Instead, the off-state third-quadrant voltage drop for the LMG342xR050 is several times higher than a p-n junction voltage drop, which can impact efficiency in normal operation and device ruggedness in fault conditions.

# 3. Special Functions of LMG3425R050
To mitigate efficiency degradation, the LMG3425R050 implements an operational ideal-diode mode (OP-IDM) function. Meanwhile, to improve device ruggedness in a GaN FET overtemperature fault situation, all devices in the LMG342xR050 family implement a GaN FET overtemperature-shutdown ideal-diode mode (OTSD-IDM) function as referenced in Overtemperature Shutdown. Both OP-IDM and OTSD-IDM are described in more detail below.

# 4. Operational Ideal-Diode Mode (LMG3425R050)
Operational ideal-diode mode (OP-IDM) is implemented in the LMG3425R050 but not in the LMG3422R050. Understand that the OP-IDM function is not a general-purpose ideal-diode mode function which allows the LMG342xR050 to autonomously operate as a diode, including as an autonomous synchronous rectifier. Furthermore, the OP-IDM function is not intended to support an ideal-diode mode transition from the on-state to the off-state in a high-voltage, hard-switched application. Exposing the LMG342xR050 to this situation is akin to operating a half-bridge power stage with negative dead time with corresponding high shoot-through current.

# 5. Specificity of LMG342xR050 OP-IDM Function
Instead, as described below, the LMG342xR050 OP-IDM function is narrowly implemented to address a specific off-state third-quadrant current flow situation while minimizing situations where the ideal-diode mode can create a dangerous shoot-through current event. OP-IDM is intended to minimize GaN FET off-state third-quadrant losses that occur in a zero-voltage switched (ZVS) event. ZVS events are seen in applications such as synchronous rectifiers and LLC converters.

# 6. ZVS Event and Power Supply Controllers
The ZVS event occurs at the FET off-state to on-state transition when an inductive element discharges the FET drain voltage before the FET is turned-on. The discharge ends with the inductive element pulling the FET drain-source voltage negative and the FET conducting off-state third-quadrant current. Power supply controllers use dead-time control to set the time for the ZVS event to complete before turning on the FET. 

# 7. Function of ZVS Time and Resulting FET Off-state Third-Quadrant Current
Both the ZVS time and resulting FET off-state third-quadrant current are a function of the power converter operation. Long ZVS time and low third-quadrant current occur when the inductive element is slewing the FET with low current and short ZVS time and high third-quadrant current occur when the inductive element is slewing at the FET with high current.

# 8. The Role of Controllers in Managing Third Quadrant Losses
Sophisticated controllers optimally adjust the dead time to minimize third-quadrant losses. Simpler controllers use a fixed dead time to handle the longest possible ZVS time. Thus, in a fixed dead-time application, the highest possible off-state third-quadrant losses occur for the longest possible time. OP-IDM mitigates the losses in a fixed dead-time application by automatically turning on the GaN FET.# 9. Operational Ideal-Diode Mode (OP-IDM) 
A new OP-IDM cycle begins in OP-IDM state #1 after the IN pin goes low in OP-IDM state #5. OP-IDM turns off the GaN FET in OP-IDM state #1. OP-IDM monitors the GaN FET drain voltage, looking for a positive drain voltage to know it can now start looking for a ZVS event. After a positive GaN FET drain voltage is detected, the device moves to OP-IDM state #2.
OP-IDM keeps the GaN FET off in OP-IDM state #2. OP-IDM continues monitoring the GaN FET drain voltage. But this time it is looking for a negative drain voltage which means third-quadrant current is flowing after a ZVS event. This is also the starting state when the device powers up or exits OTSD. After a negative GaN FET drain voltage is detected, the device moves to OP-IDM state #3.
OP-IDM turns on the GaN FET in OP-IDM state #3. OP-IDM monitors the drain current in this state. Ideally, the device simply stays in this state until IN goes high. The drain current is monitored to protect against an unexpected shoot through current event. If first quadrant drain current is detected, the device moves to OP IDM state #4.
---table begin---
Table title: Operational Ideal-Diode Mode (OP-IDM) State Machine
| State | Status | Action | Next State Upon |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | IN low | OP-IDM turns off the GaN FET | Positive VDS |
| 2 | Positive VDS | OP-IDM keeps the GaN FET off | Negative VDS due to third-quadrant drain current |
| 3 | Negative VDS | OP-IDM turns on the GaN FET | First-quadrant drain current |

after a ZVS event. This is also the starting state when the device powers up or exits OTSD. After a negative 
GaN FET drain voltage is detected, the device moves to OP-IDM state #3.
OP-IDM turns on the GaN FET in OP-IDM state #3. OP-IDM monitors the drain current in this state. Ideally, 
the device simply stays in this state until IN goes high. The drain current is monitored to protect against an 
unexpected shoot through current event. If first quadrant drain current is detected, the device moves to OP
IDM state #4.
OP-IDM locks the GaN FET off in OP-IDM state #4. The GaN FET only turns back on when the IN pin goes 
high.

# 3.4. OP-IDM State #5
The device moves to OP-IDM state #5 from any other state when the IN pin goes high. The GaN FET is 
commanded on in OP-IDM state #5. OP-IDM is idle in this state. A new OP-IDM switching cycle begins when 
IN goes low moving the device into OP-IDM state #1.
OP-IDM can only turn on the GaN FET once per IN cycle. If an unexpected shoot-through current is detected 
between OP-IDM turning on the GaN FET and the IN pin going high, OP-IDM locks the GaN FET off for the 
remainder of the IN cycle.
Understand that the OP-IDM function turns on the GaN FET, after IN goes low, if it sees a positive drain voltage 
followed by a negative drain voltage. A design using the LMG3425R030 must be analyzed for any situations 
where this sequence of events creates a shoot-through current event. The analysis must include all power 
system corner cases including start-up, shutdown, no load, overload, and fault events. Note that discontinuous 
mode conduction (DCM) operation can easily create an OP-IDM shoot-through current event when the ringing at 
the end of a DCM cycle triggers OP-IDM to turn on the GaN FET.

# 3.5. Overtemperature-Shutdown Ideal-Diode Mode
The LMG342xR050 GaN FET always goes to state #1 if a falling edge is detected on the IN pin. OTSD IDM 
turns off the GaN FET in OTSD-IDM state #1. OTSD-IDM is waiting for the IN falling edge blank time to 
expire.# 1. Overtemperature-Shutdown Ideal-Diode Mode (OTSD-IDM) State Machine
The LMG342xR050 GaN FET always goes to state #1 if a falling edge is detected on the IN pin. OTSD IDM 
turns off the GaN FET in OTSD-IDM state #1. OTSD-IDM is waiting for the IN falling edge blank time to 
expire. This time gives the opposite-side FET time to switch to create a positive drain voltage. After the blank 
time expires, the device moves to OTSD-IDM state #2.
For OTSD-IDM state #2, OTSD-IDM keeps the GaN FET off if it is coming from OTSD-IDM state #1 and 
turns the GaN FET off if it is coming from OTSD-IDM state #3. OTSD-IDM is monitoring the GaN FET drain 
voltage in OP-IDM state #2. It is looking for a negative drain voltage which means third-quadrant current is 
flowing. This is also the starting state when the device enters OTSD. After a negative GaN FET drain voltage 
is detected, the device moves to OTSD-IDM state #3
OP-IDM turns on the GaN FET in OTSD-IDM state #3. OP-IDM monitors the drain current in this state. If 
first-quadrant drain current is detected, the device moves to OP-IDM state #2.

Table Title: States of OTSD-IDM
| State | IN condition | Action | FET Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | IN falling edge | OTSD-IDM turns off the GaN FET, OTSD-IDM waiting for the IN falling edge blank time to expire | OFF |
| 2 | IN falling-edge blank time expired | OTSD-IDM looking for negative VDS | OFF |
| 3 | Negative VDS due to third-quadrant drain current | OTSD-IDM looking for first-quadrant drain current | ON |
---table end---
# 3.5. Overtemperature-Shutdown Ideal-Diode Mode
State #1 is used to protect against shoot-through current in a similar manner to OP-IDM state #1. The difference 
is that state #1 in the OTSD-IDM state machine simply waits for a fixed time period before proceeding to state 
#2. The fixed time period is to give the opposite-side switch time to switch and create a positive drain voltage. A 
fixed time is used to avoid a stuck condition for cases where a positive drain voltage is not created.
If there is no IN signal, the state machine only moves between states #2 and #3 as a classic ideal-diode mode 
state machine. This allows all the inductive elements to discharge, when the power system shuts off, with 
minimum discharge stress created in the GaN FET.

# 9.4 Start Up Sequence
Time interval A: VDD starts to build up. FAULT signal is initially pulled low.
Time interval B: After VDD passes the UVLO threshold VVDD,T+(UVLO), both LDO5V and VNEG start to built up. In a 
typical case where CLDO5V = 100 nF and CVNEG = 2.2 μF, LDO5V reaches it# 9.4. Start Up Sequence
Time interval A: VDD starts to build up. FAULT signal is initially pulled low.
Time interval B: After VDD passes the UVLO threshold VVDD,T+(UVLO), both LDO5V and VNEG start to built up. In a 
typical case where CLDO5V = 100 nF and CVNEG = 2.2 μF, LDO5V reaches its UVLO thresold earlier than VNEG. 
The start-up time may vary if different capacitors are utilized. If VDD has some glitches and falls below UVLO 
threshold VVDD,T-(UVLO) in this time interval, LDO5V and VNEG will stop building up and only resume when VDD 
goes above VVDD,T+(UVLO) again. A longer start-up time is expected in this case.
Time interval C: After LDO5V and VNEG both reach their thresholds, the FAULT signal is cleared (pulled high) 
and the device is able to switch following the IN pin signal.

# 9.5. Safe Operation Area (SOA)

# 9.5.1. Safe Operation Area (SOA) - Repetitive SOA
The allowed repetitive SOA for the LMG342xR050 (图 7-12) is defined by the peak drain current (IDS) and the 
drain to source voltage (VDS) of the device during turn on. The peak drain current during switching is the sum of 
several currents going into drain terminal: the inductor current (Iind); the current required to charge the COSS of 
the other GaN device in the totem pole; and the current required to charge the parasitic capacitance (Cpar) on 
the switching node. 145 pF is used as an average COSS of the device during switching. The parasitic 
capacitance on the switch node may be estimated by using the overlap capacitance of the PCB. A boost 
topology is used for the SOA testing. The circuit shown in 图 9-9 is used to generate the SOA curve in 图 7-12. 
For reliable operation, the junction temperature of the device must also be limited to 125 °C. The IDS of 图 7-12 
can be calculated by:
IDS = Iind + (145 pF + Cpar) * Drain slew rate at peak current
where drain slew rate at the peak current is estimated between 70 percent and 30 percent of the bus voltage, 
and Cpar is the parasitic board capacitance at the switched node.

applications like the totem-pole PFC. Low Qoss of GaN devices also benefits soft-switching converters, such as 
the LLC and phase-shifted full-bridge configurations. As half-bridge configurations are the foundation of the two

# 10.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure
In high-voltage power converters, circuit design and PCB layout are essential for high-performance power converters. As designing a power converter is out of the scope of this document, this data sheet describes how to build well-behaved half-bridge configurations with the LMG342xR050.

# 10.2.2.1 Slew Rate Selection
The slew rate of LMG342xR050 can be adjusted between approximately 20 V/ns and 150 V/ns by connecting a resistor, RRDRV, from the RDRV pin to GND. The RDRV pin is a high-impedance node if a large RRDRV resistor is used. Therefore it can be susceptible to coupling from the drain or other fast-slewing high-voltage nodes if it isn’t well-shielded. This will manifest itself as an unstable switching dv/dt and in extreme cases transient faults due to the RDRV being detected as open. Shielding the pin in the layout should be a priority, however if this coupling is still a problem, a cap of up to 1nF from RDRV to GND can be added to stabilize the pin voltage.
The slew rate affects GaN device performance in terms of:
•  Switching loss
•  Voltage overshoot
•  Noise coupling
•  EMI emission
Generally, high slew rates provide low switching loss, but high slew rates can also create higher voltage overshoot, noise coupling, and EMI emissions. Following the design recommendations in this data sheet helps mitigate the challenges caused by a high slew rate. The LMG342xR050 offers circuit designers the flexibility to select the proper slew rate for the best performance of their applications.

# 10.2.2.1.1 Start-Up and Slew Rate With Bootstrap High-Side Supply
Using a bootstrap supply introduces additional constraints on the start-up of the high-side LMG342xR050. Prior to powering up, the GaN device operates in cascode mode with reduced performance. In some circuits, a proper slew rate can be required for the start-up of a bootstrap-supplied half-bridge configuration.

# 10.2.2.2 Signal Level-Shifting
In half-bridges, high-voltage level shifters or digital isolators must be used to provide isolation for signal paths between the high-side device and control circuit. Using an isolator is optional for the low-side device. However, using and isolator equalizes the propagation delays between the high-side and low-side signal paths, and provides the ability to use different grounds for the GaN device and the controller. If an isolator is not used on the low-side device, the control ground and the power ground must be connected at the device and nowhere else on the board. For more information, see Layout Guidelines. With fast-switching devices, common ground inductance can easily cause noise issues without the use of an isolator.
Choosing a digital isolator for level-shifting is important for improvement of noise immunity. As GaN device can easily create high dv/dt, > 50 V/ns, in hard-switching applications, TI highly recommends to use isolators with h# 1. Ground Connection for GaN Devices and Controller
Different grounds for the GaN device and the controller. If an isolator is not used on the low-side device, the control ground and the power ground must be connected at the device and nowhere else on the board. For more information, see Layout Guidelines. With fast-switching devices, common ground inductance can easily cause noise issues without the use of an isolator.

# 2. Choosing a Digital Isolator for Level-shifting
Choosing a digital isolator for level-shifting is important for improvement of noise immunity. As GaN device can easily create high dv/dt, > 50 V/ns, in hard-switching applications, TI highly recommends to use isolators with high common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) and low barrier capacitance. Isolators with low CMTI can easily generate false signals, which could cause shoot-through. The barrier capacitance is part of the isolation capacitance between the signal ground and power ground, which is in direct proportion to the common mode current and EMI emission generated during the switching. Additionally, TI strongly encourages to select isolators which are not edge-triggered. In an edge-triggered isolator, a high dv/dt event can cause the isolator to flip states and cause circuit malfunction.

# 3. Preferred Isolators 
Generally, ON/OFF keyed isolators with default output low are preferred, such as the TI ISO77xxF series. Default low state ensures the system will not shoot-through when starting up or recovering from fault events. As a high CMTI event would only cause a very short (a few nanoseconds) false pulse, TI recommends a low pass filter, like 300 Ω and 22 pF R-C filter, to be placed at the driver input to filter out these false pulses.

# 6. Do's and Don'ts
The successful use of GaN devices in general, and LMG342xR050 in particular, depends on proper use of the device. When using the LMG342xR050, DO:
Read and fully understand the data sheet, including the application notes and layout recommendations.
Use a four-layer board and place the return power path on an inner layer to minimize power-loop inductance.
Use small, surface-mount bypass and bus capacitors to minimize parasitic inductance.
Use the proper size decoupling capacitors and locate them close to the IC as described in Layout Guidelines.
Use a signal isolator to supply the input signal for the low-side device. If not, ensure the signal source is 
connected to the signal GND plane which is tied to the power source only.# 1. Guidelines
Do:
- Read and fully understand the data sheet, including the application notes and layout recommendations.
- Use a four-layer board and place the return power path on an inner layer to minimize power-loop inductance.
- Use small, surface-mount bypass and bus capacitors to minimize parasitic inductance.
- Use the proper size decoupling capacitors and locate them close to the IC as described in Layout Guidelines.
- Use a signal isolator to supply the input signal for the low-side device. If not, ensure the signal source is connected to the signal GND plane which is tied to the power source only at the LMG342xR050 IC.
- Use the FAULT pin to determine power-up state and to detect overcurrent and overtemperature events and safely shut off the converter.
Don't:
- Use a single-layer or two-layer PCB for the LMG342xR050 as the power-loop and bypass capacitor inductances is excessive and prevent proper operation of the IC.
- Reduce the bypass capacitor values below the recommended values.
- Allow the device to experience drain transients above 600 V as they can damage the device.
- Allow significant third-quadrant conduction when the device is OFF or unpowered, which can cause overheating. Self-protection features cannot protect the device in this mode of operation.
- Ignore the FAULT pin output.

# 11. Power Supply Recommendations
The LMG342xR050 only requires an unregulated VDD power supply from 7.5 V to 18 V. The low-side supply can be obtained from the local controller supply. The supply of the high-side device must come from an isolated supply or a bootstrap supply.

# 11.1. Using an Isolated Power Supply
Using an isolated power supply to power the high-side device has the advantage that it works regardless of continued power-stage switching or duty cycle. Using an isolated power supply can also power the high-side device before power-stage switching begins, eliminating the power-loss concern of switching with an unpowered LMG342xR050 (see Start-Up and Slew Rate With Bootstrap High-Side Supply for details). Finally, a properly-selected isolated supply introduces less parasitics and reduces noise coupling.
The isolated supply can be obtained with a push-pull converter, a flyback converter, a FlyBuck™ converter, or an isolated power module. When using an unregulated supply, the input of LMG342xR050 must not exceed the maximum supply voltage. A 16-V TVS diode can be used to clamp the VDD voltage of LMG342xR050 for additional protection. Minimizing the inter-winding capacitance of the isolated power supply or transformer is necessary to reduce switching loss in hard-switched applications. Furthermore, capacitance across the isolated bias supply inject high currents into the signal-ground of the LMG342xR050 and can cause problematic ground-bounce transients. A common-mode choke can alleviate most of these issues.

# 11.2. Using a Bootstrap Diode
In half-bridge configuration, a floating supply is necessary for the high-side device. To obtain the best performance of LMG342xR050, Ti highly recommends Using an Isolated Power Supply. A bootstrap supply can be used with the recommendations of this section.
In applications like a boost converter, the low side LMG342xR050 always start switching while high side LMG342xR050 is unpowered. If the low side is adjusted to achieve very high slew rate before the high side bias is fully settled, there can be unintentional turn-on at the high side due to parasitic coupling at high slew rate. The start-up slew rate must be slowed down to 20 V/n.# 11.2.1 Diode Selection
The LMG342xR050 offers no reverse-recovery charge and very limited output charge. Hard-switching circuits 
using the LMG342xR050 also exhibit high voltage slew rates. A compatible bootstrap diode must not introduce 
high output charge and reverse-recovery charge.
A silicon carbide diode, like the GB01SLT06-214, can be used to avoid reverse-recovery effects. The SiC diode 
has an output charge of 3 nC. Althought there is additional loss from its output charge, it does not dominate the 
losses of the switching stage.

# 11.2.2 Managing the Bootstrap Voltage
In a synchronous buck or other converter where the low-side switch occasionally operates in third-quadrant, the 
bootstrap supply charges through a path that includes the third-quadrant voltage drop of the low-side 
LMG342xR050 during the dead time as shown in 图 11-1. This third-quadrant drop can be large, which can over-
charge the bootstrap supply in certain conditions. The VDD supply of LMG342xR050 must be kept below 18 V.
As shown in 图 11-2, the recommended bootstrap supply includes a bootstrap diode, a series resistor, and a 16-
V TVS or zener diode in parallel with the VDD bypass capacitor to prevent damaging the high-side 
LMG342xR050. The series resistor limits the charging current at start-up and when the low-side device is 
operating in third-quadrant mode. This resistor must be selected to allow sufficient current to power the 
LMG342xR050 at the desired operating frequency. At 100-kHz operation, TI recommends a value of 
approximately 2 Ω . At higher frequencies, this resistor value must be reduced or the resistor omitted entirely to 
ensure sufficient supply current.

# 12 Layout

# 12.1 Layout Guidelines
The layout of the LMG342xR050 is critical to its performance and functionality. Because the half-bridge 
configuration is typically used with these GaN devices, layout recommendations are considered with this 
configuration. A four-layer or higher layer count board is required to reduce the parasitic inductances of the 
layout to achieve suitable performance.

# 12.1.1 Solder-Joint Reliability
Large QFN packages can experience high solder-joint stress. TI recommends several best practices to ensure 
solder-joint reliability. First, the instructions for the NC1 and NC2 anchor pins found in 表 6-1 must be followed. 
Second, all the LMG342xR050 board solder pads must be non-solder-mask defined (NSMD) as shown in the 
land pattern example in Mechanical, Packaging, and Orderable Information. Finally, any board trace connected 
to an NSMD pad must be less than 2/3 the width of the pad on the pad side where it is connected. The trace 
must mainta# 12.1.1 Solder-Joint Reliability
Large QFN packages can experience high solder-joint stress. TI recommends several best practices to ensure solder-joint reliability. First, the instructions for the NC1 and NC2 anchor pins found in 表 6-1 must be followed. Second, all the LMG342xR050 board solder pads must be non-solder-mask defined (NSMD) as shown in the land pattern example in Mechanical, Packaging, and Orderable Information. Finally, any board trace connected to an NSMD pad must be less than 2/3 the width of the pad on the pad side where it is connected. The trace must maintain this 2/3 width limit for as long as it is not covered by solder mask. After the trace is under solder mask, there are no limits on the trace dimensions. All these recommendations are followed in the Layout Example.

# 12.1.2 Power-Loop Inductance
The power loop, comprising the two devices in the half bridge and the high-voltage bus capacitance, undergoes high di/dt during switching events. By minimizing the inductance of this loop, ringing and electro-magnetic interference (EMI) can be reduced, as well as reducing voltage stress on the devices. 
Place the power devices as close as possible to minimize the power-loop inductance. The decoupling capacitors are positioned in line with the two devices. They can be placed close to either device. In Layout Examples, the decoupling capacitors are placed on the same layer as the devices. The return path (PGND in this case) is located on second layer in close proximity to the top layer. By using inner layer and not bottom layer, the vertical dimension of the loop is reduced, thus minimizing inductance. A large number of vias near both the device terminal and bus capacitance carries the high-frequency switching current to inner layer while minimizing impedance. 
The power loop inductance can be estimated based on the ringing frequency fring of the drain-source voltage switching waveform based on the following equation

# 12.1.3 Signal-Ground Connection
The LMG342xR050's SOURCE pin is internally connected to GND pins of the power IC, the signal-ground reference. Local signal-ground planes must be connected to GND pins with low impedance star connection. In addition, the return path for the passives associated to the driver (for example, bypass capacitance) must be connected to the GND pins. In Layout Example, local signal-ground planes are located on second layer to act as the return path for the local circuitry. The local signal-ground planes are not connected to the high-current SOURCE pins except the star connection at GND pins.

# 12.1.4 Bypass Capacitors
The gate drive loop impedance must be minimized to obtain good performance. Although the gate driver is integrated on package, the bypass capacitance for the driver is placed externally. As the GaN device is turned off to a negative voltage, the impedance of the path to the external VNEG capacitor is included in the gate drive loop. The VNEG capacitor must be placed close to VNEG and GND pins.The VDD pin bypass capacitors, C1 and C11, must also be placed close to the VDD pin.# 12.1.4 Bypass Capacitors
The gate drive loop impedance must be minimized to obtain good performance. Although the gate driver is integrated on package, the bypass capacitance for the driver is placed externally. As the GaN device is turned off to a negative voltage, the impedance of the path to the external VNEG capacitor is included in the gate drive loop. The VNEG capacitor must be placed close to VNEG and GND pins.The VDD pin bypass capacitors, C1 and C11, must also be placed close to the VDD pin with low impedance connections.

# 12.1.5 Switch-Node Capacitance
GaN devices have very low output capacitance and switch quickly with a high dv/dt, yielding very low switching losses. To preserve this low switching losses, additional capacitance added to the output node must be minimized. The PCB capacitance at the switch node can be minimized by following these guidelines:
• Minimize overlap between the switch-node plane and other power and ground planes.
• Make the GND return path under the high-side device thinner while still maintaining a low-inductance path.
• Choose high-side isolator ICs and bootstrap diodes with low capacitance.
• Place the power inductor as close to the GaN device as possible.
• Power inductors must be constructed with a single-layer winding to minimize intra-winding capacitance.
• If a single-layer inductor is not possible, consider placing a small inductor between the primary inductor and the GaN device to effectively shield the GaN device from the additional capacitance.
• If a back-side heat-sink is used, use the least amount of area of the switch-node copper coverage on the bottom copper layer to improve the thermal dissipation.

# 12.1.6 Signal Integrity
The control signals to the LMG342xR050 must be protected from the high dv/dt caused by fast switching. Coupling between the control signals and the drain can cause circuit instability and potential destruction. Route the control signals (IN, FAULT and OC) over a ground plane placed on an adjacent layer. In Layout Example, for example, all the signals are routed on layers close to the local signal ground plane.
Capacitive coupling between the traces for the high-side device and the static planes, such as PGND and HVBUS, could cause common mode current and ground bounce. The coupling can be mitigated by reducing overlap between the high-side traces and the static planes. For the high-side level shifter, ensure no copper from either the input or output side extends beneath the isolator or the CMTI of the device can be compromised.

# 12.1.7 High-Voltage Spacing
Circuits using the LMG342xR050 involve high voltage, potentially up to 600 V. When laying out circuits using the LMG342xR050, understand the creepage and clearance requirements for the application and how they apply to the GaN device. Functional (or working) isolation is required between the source and drain of each transistor, and between the high-voltage power supply and ground. Functional isolation or perhaps stronger isolation (such as reinforced isolation) can be required between the input circuitry to the LMG342xR050 and the power controller. Choose signal isolators and PCB spacing (creepage and clearance) distances which meet your isolation requirements.
If a heat sink is used to manage thermal dissipation of the LMG342xR050, ensure necessary electrical isolation and mechanical spacing is maintained between the heat sink and the PCB.

# 12.1.8 Thermal Recommendations
The LMG342xR050 is a lateral# 12.1.8 Thermal Recommendations
The LMG342xR050 is a lateral device grown on a Si substrate. The thermal pad is connected to the source of device. The LMG342xR050 can be used in applications with significant power dissipation, for example, hard-switched power converters. In these converters, cooling using just the PCB can not be sufficient to keep the part at a reasonable temperature. To improve the thermal dissipation of the part, TI recommends a heat sink is connected to the back of the PCB to extract additional heat. Using power planes and numerous thermal vias, the heat dissipated in the LMG342xR050 can be spread out in the PCB and effectively passed to the other side of the PCB. A heat sink can be applied to bare areas on the back of the PCB using an thermal interface material (TIM). The solder mask from the back of the board underneath the heat sink can be removed for more effective heat removal. Refer to the High Voltage Half Bridge Design Guide for LMG3410 Smart GaN FET application note for more recommendations and performance data on thermal layouts.

# 12.2 Layout Examples
Correct layout of the LMG342xR050 and its surrounding components is essential for correct operation. The layouts shown here reflect the GaN device schematic in 图 10-1. These layouts are shown to produce good results and is intended as a guideline. However, it can be possible to obtain acceptable performance with alternate layout schemes. Additionally, please refer to the land pattern example in Mechanical, Packaging, and Orderable Information for the latest recommended PCB footprint of the device. The the top-layer layout and mid-layer layout are shown. The layouts are zoomed in to the LMG342xR050 U1 and U2 component placements. The mid-layer layout includes the outlines of the top level components to assist the reader in lining up the top-layer and mid-layer layouts.
