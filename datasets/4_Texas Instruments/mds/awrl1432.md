# 8.12.5.2 RDIF Data Format
The samples are sent one channel by one channel as shown in the diagram above. All the 12-bits of one 
channel are sent on 4 data lanes in 3 DDR_CLK edges, followed by next RX channel.
The frame clock (FRM_CLK) spans 12 DDR_CLK edges and 48 bits are sent in 1 FRM_CLK
The FRM_CLK can have gaps in between. This is required as the interface rate is greater than the incoming 
rate
DDR_CLK is continuous.
DDR_CLK is generated from 400MHz ADC CLK (one of the ADC CLKs) - selected for the DFE. It is the same 
400MHz clock selected for DFE.
New sample always starts at the rise edge of the DDR_CLK
The FRM_CLK is valid for the entire data bit and is meets the Tsu/Th wrt DDR_CLK.

# 9.1 Overview
The AWRL1432 device is a complete SOC which include mmWave front end, customer programmable MCU and analog baseband signal chain for two transmitters and three receivers. This device is applicable as a radar-on-a-
chip in use-cases with quality provision for memory, processing capacity, and application code size. These could 
be cost-effective automotive applications that are evolving from 24-GHz narrowband implementation and some 
emerging radar applications. Typical application examples for this device include gesture detection and kick 
sensor. In terms of scalability, the AWRL1432 device could be paired with a low-end external MCU, to address 
more complex applications that might require additional memory for larger application software footprint and 
faster interfaces. The AWRL1432 device also provides high speed data interfaces like RDIF and is suitable for

# 9.3 Subsystems

# 9.3.1 RF and Analog Subsystem
The RF and analog subsystem includes the RF and analog circuitry – namely, the synthesizer, PA, LNA, mixer, 
IF, and ADC. This subsystem also includes the crystal oscillator and temperature sensors. The two TX can be 
operated simultaneously for beam forming in BPM mode or individually in TDM mode. Similarly, the device 
allows configuring the number of receive channels based on application and power requirements. For system 
power saving, RF and analog subsystems can be put into low power mode configuration.

# 9.3.2 Clock Subsystem
The AWRL1432 clock subsystem generates 76 to 81 GHz from an input reference from a crystal. It has a built-in 
oscillator circuit followed by a clean-up PLL and a RF synthesizer circuit. The output of the RF synthesizer is 
then processed by an X4 multiplier to create the required frequency in the 76 to 81 GHz spectrum. The RF 
synthesizer output is modulated by the timing engine block to create the required waveforms for effective sensor 
operation.
The clean-up PLL also provides a reference clock for the host processor after system wakeup.
The clock subsystem also has built-in mechanisms for detecting the presence of a crystal and monitoring the 
quality of the generated clock.

# 9.3.3 Transmit Subsystem
The AWRL1432 transmit subsystem consists of two parallel transmit chains, each with independent phase and 
amplitude control. The device supports binary phase modulation for MIMO radar.
The transmit chains also support programmable backoff for system optimization.

# 9.3.4 Receive Subsystem
The AWRL1432 receive subsystem consists of three parallel channels. A single receive channel consists of an 
LNA, mixer, IF filtering, ADC conversion, and decimation. All three receive channels can either operate 
simultaneously OR can be powered down individually based on system power needs and application design.
The AWRL1432 device supports a real baseband architecture, which uses real mixer, single IF and ADC chains 
to provide output for each receiver channel. The device is targeted for fast chirp systems. The band-pass IF 
chain has configurable lower cutoff frequencies above 175 kHz and can support bandwidths up to 5 MHz.

# 9.3.8. Main Subsystem Cortex-M4F
The main system includes an ARM Cortex M4F processor clocked with a maximum operating frequency of 160 
MHz. User applications executing on this processor control the overall operation of the device, including radar 
control through well-defined API messages, radar signal processing (assisted by the radar hardware 
accelerator), and peripherals for external interfaces.

# 9.4 Other Subsystems

# 9.4.1 GPADC Channels (Service) for User Application
The AWRL1432 device includes provision for an ADC service for user application, where the GPADC engine 
present inside the device can be used to measure up to two external voltages. The GPADC1, and GPADC2 pins 
are used for this purpose.
- GPADC itself is controlled by TI firmware running inside the FEC subsystem and access to it for customer’s 
external voltage monitoring purpose is via ‘APPSS’ calls routed to the FEC subsystem. This API could be 
linked with the user application running on MSS M4F.
- Device Firmware package (DFP) provides APIs to configure and measure these signals. The API allows 
configuring the settling time (number of ADC samples to skip) and number of consecutive samples to take. At 
the end of a frame, the minimum, maximum and average of the readings will be reported for each of the 
monitored voltages.

# 11 Device and Documentation Support
TI offers an extensive line of development tools. Tools and software to evaluate the performance of the device, generate code, and develop solutions follow.

# 11.1 Device Nomenclature
To designate the stages in the product development cycle, TI assigns prefixes to the part numbers of all microprocessors (MPUs) and support tools. Each device has one of three prefixes: X, P, or null (no prefix) (for example, AWRL1432). Texas Instruments recommends two of three possible prefix designators for its support tools: TMDX and TMDS. These prefixes represent evolutionary stages of product development from engineering prototypes (TMDX) through fully qualified production devices and tools (TMDS).
Device development evolutionary flow:
X - Experimental device that is not necessarily representative of the final device's electrical specifications and may not use production assembly flow.
P - Prototype device that is not necessarily the final silicon die and may not necessarily meet final electrical specifications.
null - Production version of the silicon die that is fully qualified.
Support tool development evolutionary flow:
* TMDX - Development-support product that has not yet completed Texas Instruments internal qualification testing.
* TMDS - Fully-qualified development-support product.
X and P devices and TMDX development-support tools are shipped against the following disclaimer: "Developmental product is intended for internal evaluation purposes."
Production devices and TMDS development-support tools have been characterized fully, and the quality and reliability of the device have been demonstrated fully. TI's standard warranty applies.
Predictions show that prototype devices (X or P) have a greater failure rate than the standard production devices. Texas Instruments recommends that these devices not be used in any production system because their expected end-use failure rate still is undefined. Only qualified production devices are to be used.
TI device nomenclature also includes a suffix with the device family name. This suffix indicates the package type (for example, ABL0161), the temperature range (for example, blank is the default commercial temperature range). 图 11-1 provides a legend for reading the complete device name for any AWRL1432device.
For orderable part numbers of AWRL1432 devices in the ABL0161 package types, see the Package Option Addendum of this document (when available), the TI website (www.ti.com), or contact your TI sales representative.
