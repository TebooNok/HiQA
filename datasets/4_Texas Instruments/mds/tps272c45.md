| Device | Integrated Low Voltage Regulator | Integrated Clamp for Inductive Loads | Fault Diagnosis | Current Limit | Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TPS272C45A | No | Yes | Single FLT pin, SNS pin provides per -ch fault | Dual level, inrush period | Lower device power dissipation with most of the quiescent current drawn from the lower voltage supply input – enables reduced total heat dissipation and thus smaller module sizes. Connect a 3.3V DC-DC regulator output to VDD pin. Single fault pin reduces IO count. |
| TPS272C45B | Yes | Yes | Single FLT pin, SNS pin provides per -ch fault | Dual level, inrush period | Lower system costs with a single power supply (cost of a low voltage regulator is avoided). |
| TPS272C45C | Yes | No | Single FLT pin, SNS pin provides per -ch fault | Dual level, inrush period | Enables usage of external TVS Clamp for high inductive loading. The device variant can be used with an external supply on VDD pin or using the internal 3.3-V regulation by GNDing the VDD pin. |
| TPS272C45D | Yes | Yes | Dual fault FLT1/ FLT2 pins | Single level | Dual FLT pins provides easier fault diagnosis. The device variant can be used with an external supply on VDD pin or using the internal 3.3-V regulation by GNDing the VDD pin. |

# 9. Detailed Description
9.1 Overview
The TPS272C45 device is a dual channel 45-mΩ smart high-side switch that is intended to provide protection 
for output ports in 24-V Industrial systems. The device is designed to drive a variety of resistive, inductive and 
capacitive loads. The device integrates various protection features including overload protection through current 
limiting, thermal protection, and short-circuit protection. For more details on the protection features, refer to the 
Feature Description and Application Information sections of the document.
In addition, the device diagnostics features include the analog SNS output that is capable of providing a signal 
proportional to the load current flowing through the switch or constant high current as a fault indication. The 
high-accuracy load current sense allows for integration of load diagnostic features that can enable predictive 
maintenance for the system by watching for leading indicators of load failures. The device also integrates open 
load detection to enable protection against wire breaks. In addition, the device includes a single open drain FLT 
pin output (version A, B, C) and dual FLT pin outputs (version D) that indicate device fault states such as short to 
GND, short to supply, or overtemperature.
The TPS272C45 is one device in TI's industrial high side switch family. For each device, the part number 
indicates elements of the device behavior.

# 9.3. Feature Description

# 9.3.1. Programmable Current Limit
The TPS272C45 integrates a dual stage adjustable current limit. For the most efficient and reliable output protection, the current limit can be set as close to the DC current level as possible. Sometimes, systems require high inrush current handling as well (example incandescent lamp and capacitive loads). By integrating a dual stage current limit, the TPS272C45 enables robust DC current limiting while still allowing flexible inrush handling.
With the adjustable current limit feature, a lower current limit setting can reduce the fault energy and the output current during a load failure event such as a short-circuit or a partial load short (soft-short). By lowering fault energy and current, the overall system improves through:
- Reduced size and cost in current carrying components such as PCB traces and module connectors
- Less disturbance at the power supply (VS pin) during a short circuit event
- Less additional budget for the power supply to account for overload currents in one channel or more
- Improved protection of the downstream load

# 9.3.1.1. Inrush Current Handling
The TPS272C45 uses a resistor from the following pins to the IC GND to configure the current limit behavior: ILIM1, ILIM2, and ILIMD. The ILIM1 and ILIM2 pin resistors set the current limit thresholds for CH1 and CH2 respectively while ILIMD pin resistor sets a delay time for the device to operate in a higher or lower current limit during device start-up or output turn-on by retry after a fault (thermal) shutdown).

The ILIM1/ILIM2 thresholds and the ILIMD pin resistor controlled timing enable flexible inrush current control behavior. The following table shows the various options available.

---table end---

# 3. Inrush Current Control - Case 2
For the Case 2, when the ENx pin goes high to turn on one of the channels (or the channel is turned on automatically to retry after a fault shutdwon), the device defaults to twice current limit threshold as determined by RILIM1/RILIM2 or the maximum internal current limit level (whichever is lower). The internal current limit level is defined in the Specifications section of this document. After a TDELAY period that is determined by RILIMD, the current limit changes to the threshold determined by RILIM1/RILIM2. The delay can be set in the range from 0 (the current limit threshold at all times set to that determined by RILIM1/RILIM2) to a maximum of 22 ms in dscrete steps.

# 3.1. Multichannel Independent Operation
Each channel operates independently with current limit thresholds controlled by RILIM1 and RILIM2(so both channels can have separate current limit thresholds). If channel 2 is enabled after channel one, channel 2 has its own separate timing.

# 3.2. Advantages of Initial Inrush Current
The initial inrush current period when the current limit is higher enables two different system advantages when driving loads:
- Enables higher load current to be supported for a period of time of the order of milliseconds to drive high inrush current loads like incandescent bulb loads.
- Enables fast capacitive load charging. In some situations, it is ideal to charge capacitive loads at a higher current than the DC current to ensure quick supply bring up. This architecture allows a module to quickly charge a capacitive load using the initial higher inrush current limit and then use a lower current limit to reliably protect the module under overload or short circuit conditions.

# 4. Over-Temperature Shutdown
While in current limiting mode, at any level, the device has a high power dissipation. If the FET temperature exceeds the over-temperature shutdown threshold, the device turns off just the channel that is overloaded. After cooling down, the device either latches off or re-tries, depending on the state of the LATCH pin. If the device is turning off prematurely on start-up, TI recommends to improve the PCB thermal layout, lower the current limit to lower power dissipation, or decrease the inrush current (capacitive loading).

# 5. Calculating RILIMx
To set the current limit thresholds, connect resistors from both ILIM1 and ILIM2 pins to GND. The current limit threshold for each channel is determined by Equation 1 (RILIMx in kΩ):
ICL = KCL / RILIMx (1)
The nominal KCL value to be used in the calculation is 20.5 A.kΩ. The allowed RILIMx range is between 5 kΩ and 28.# 9.3.1.2 Calculating RILIMx
To set the current limit thresholds, connect resistors from both ILIM1 and ILIM2 pins to GND. The current limit threshold for each channel is determined by Equation 1 (RILIMx in kΩ):
ICL = KCL / RILIMx
The nominal KCL value to be used in the calculation is 20.5 A.kΩ. The allowed RILIMx range is between 5 kΩ and 28.

# 9.3.1.3 Configuring ILIMx From an MCU
In many situations, modules like to allow the current limit to be set programmatically from an MCU. This action enables a module to set current limits to fit the load after determining what load is plugged in. As described, the TPS272C45 current limits are set by RILIMx. However, the RILIMx that is seen by the device can be configured through small external FETs as shown in the figure.
For example, RILIM1_1 can set the device to 500-mA ILIM while RILIM1_2 can set the device at 2-A ILIM. After the MCU realizes how much current draw is required by the load, the MCU can drive one of the series FET's to set the ILIM to be ideal for the specific load. The current limit (ILIM1 and ILIM2) thresholds can be changed dynamically, but the inrush current limit delay set with the ILIMD resistor cannot be changed after power-up.
The external FET switches used to dynamically adjust the current limit must be chosen with a minimum capacitance (Coss) from the drain to the ground. The total capacitance to PCB ground at the ILMx pins including from traces must be limited to less than 100 pF.

# 9.3.2 Low Power Dissipation
The table shows the impact this second supply can make on the total device power dissipation calculated at a worst case supply voltage of 30 V, without diagnostics enabled. There is an additional contribution to power dissipation from the current sense circuitry as well as the sensed current out of the SNS pin when diagnostics are enabled. Savings of over 80 mW per channel in the IC is achieved by powering the device with a separate 3.3-V supply.# Case supply voltage of 30 V

---table end---
# 9.3.2 Low Power Dissipation
By using version TPS272C45A and providing a 3.3-V supply to the VDD pin, for a 500-mA output module the worst case device total heating is cut from 250 mW to 89 mW, about a 30% decrease in per channel power dissipation. This lower power dissipation, in addition to the small size of the TPS272C45, enables modules that have many low current outputs to shrink the size of their casings without limiting output power distribution capability. To minimize power dissipation, the VDD supply must be powered by a small DC/DC providing the less than 5 mA per device. Multiple devices can use one DC/DC converter to limit system costs, as shown in 图 9-6.

# Secondary Low Voltage Supply Schematic
For higher current modules, the resistive losses dominate the total power dissipation and the impact of the secondary supply is less valuable. For example, 表 9-3 shows that for a 2-A output, providing the secondary supply lowers the total device dissipation by only 12%. In this case, to lower total system costs, versions with an internal regulator that need only single supply input can be used. If using versions C or D and the secondary supply is not useful or available, the VDD pin can be grounded and all current is drawn from the primary supply with no loss of functionality, but higher power dissipation.

# 9.3.3 Protection Mechanisms
The TPS272C45 protects the system against load fault events like short circuits, inductive load kickback, overload events, overvoltage and over-temperature events. This section describes the details for protecting against each of these fault cases.
There are a number of protection features which, if triggered, causes the switch to automatically disable:
- Current limit
- Thermal shutdown
- DC overvoltage on VS supply above the overvoltage protection threshold, VOVPR
When one of these protections are triggered for either channel, the device enters the FAULT state. In the FAULT state, the fault indication is available on the FLT pin for an MCU to monitor and react to.
The fault indication is reset and the switch turns back on when all of the below conditions are met:
- LATCH pin is low
- tRETRY has expired
- All faults are cleared (thermal shutdown, current limit, overvoltage)

# 9.3.3.1 Short-Circuit Protection
TPS272C45 provides output short-circuit protection to ensure that the device prevents current flow in the event of a low impedance path to GND, removing the risk of damage or significant supply droop. The device is specified to protect against short-circuit events regardless of the state of the ILIM pins and or supply voltages up to 36V and across the entire operating temperature range -40 °C 125°C.
图 9-7 shows the behavior of the TPS272C45 when the device is enabled into an overload condition and then recovers to a normal load.# 9.3.3.1 Short-Circuit Protection
TPS272C45 provides output short-circuit protection to ensure that the device prevents current flow in the event of a low impedance path to GND, removing the risk of damage or significant supply droop. The device is specified to protect against short-circuit events regardless of the state of the ILIM pins and or supply voltages up to 36V and across the entire operating temperature range -40 °C 125°C.
图 9-7 shows the behavior of the TPS272C45 when the device is enabled into an overload condition and then recovers to a normal load.
Due to the low impedance path, the output current rapidly increases until it hits the current limit threshold. Due to the response time of the current limiting circuit, the measured maximum current can temporarily exceed the ICL value defined as ICL_ENPS, before it settles to the current limit regulation value (ICL).
In this state high power is dissipated in the FET, so eventually the internal thermal protection temperature for the FET is reached and the device safely shuts down. Then if LATCH pin is low the part waits tRETRY amount of time and turns back on.

# 9.3.3.2 On-State Short-Circuit Behavior
图 9-8 shows the behavior of the TPS272C45 when a short-circuit occurs when the device is in the on-state and already outputting current. When the internal pass FET is fully enabled, the current clamping settling time is slower so to ensure overshoot is limit, the device implements a fast trip turn-off at a high current threshold (approximately 40% higher than ICL). When this fast trip threshold is hit, the device shuts off after a delay for a short period of time before quickly re-enabling and clamping the current to the regulation current limit level (ICL) after a brief transient overshoot to the higher peak current level. The device then keeps the current clamped at the regulation current limit until the thermal shutdown temperature is hit and the device safely shuts off.

# 9.3.3.2.1 On-State Overload Behavior
Overload Behavior shows the behavior of the TPS272C45 when there is a small change in impedance that sends the load current above the ICL threshold. The current rises to ICL_LIN above the regulation level. Then the current limit regulation loop kicks in and the current drops to the ICL value.
In all of these cases, the internal thermal shutdown is safe to hit repetitively. There is no device risk or lifetime reliability concerns from repeatedly hitting this thermal shutdown level.

# 9.3.3.2.2 VS During Short-to-Ground
When VOUT is shorted to ground, the module power supply (VS) can see a transient decrease. This decrease is caused by the sudden increase in current flowing through the cable inductance. For ideal system behavior, TI recommends that the module maintain VS > 3 V (above the maximum VUVLOF) during VOUT short-to-ground. This event is typically accomplished by placing bulk capacitance on the power supply node. If VS goes below VUVLOF, the device can sustain unexpected latch and timing behavior.

# 9.3.3.3 Inductive Load Demagnetization
When switching off an inductive load, the inductor can impose a negative voltage on the output of the switch. The TPS272C45 includes voltage clamps between VS and VOUT to limit the voltage across the FETs and demagnetize load inductance if there is any. The negative voltage applied at the OUT pin drives the discharge of inductor current. 图# 9.3.3.2 Inductive Load Demagnetization

The TPS272C45 includes voltage clamps between VS and VOUT to limit the voltage across the FETs and 
demagnetize load inductance if there is any. The negative voltage applied at the OUT pin drives the discharge of 
inductor current.

# 9.3.3.3 Thermal Shutdown
The TPS272C45 includes a temperature sensor on the power FET and also within the controller portion of the 
device. The device registers a thermal shutdown fault:
• TJ,FET > TABS
• TJ,FET - TJ,control > TREL
After the fault is detected, the switch turns off. If TJ,FET passes TABS, the fault is cleared when the switch 
temperature decreases by the hysteresis value, THYS. If instead the TREL threshold is exceeded, the fault is 
cleared after TRETRY passes.

# 9.3.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout on VS (UVLO)
The device monitors the supply voltage at the VS pin to prevent unpredicted behaviors in the event that the 
supply voltage is too low. When the supply voltage falls down to VUVLOF, the device enters the shut down state 
automatically.

# 9.3.3.5 Undervoltage Lockout on Low Voltage Supply (VDD_UVLO)
The device monitors the input supply voltage VVDD (in versions A/C/D with external supply input) to prevent 
unpredictable behavior in the event that the supply voltage is too low. When the supply voltage falls down to 
VVDD_UVLOF, the device switches operation to the VS (24 V) power supply, but results in increased current draw 
from the VS supply input.

# 9.3.3.6 Power-Up and Power-Down Behavior
All versions of the device power up from the OFF state only when the VS supply input exceeds the VVSUVLOR threshold (independent of the VDD supply input level). When VS supply is above the threshold, the internal regulators are enabled, the device version is recognized. The device then enters the standby state. With versions A, C, and D and using using an external supply on VDD pin - the device will use the internal regulators until the VDD voltage exceeds VVDD_UVLOR. In case the VDD power supply is enabled first and the VDD voltage exceeds VVDD_UVLOR before the VS supply is up and the VS voltage exceeds VSUVLOR, the device remains in the off-state.

# 9.3.3.7 Overvoltage Protection (OVPR)
The device monitors the supply voltage VVS to prevent higher voltages from appearing at the output than can be supported by the load, when the supply voltage is too high. When the supply voltage goes above VVS_OVPR, the FET is shut down automatically after a deglitch time to prevent short transients or noise from triggering the protection. When the supply falls below VVS_OVPF, the FET is allowed to turn back on.

# 9.3.4 Diagnostic Mechanisms
As systems demand more intelligence, it is becoming increasingly important to have robust diagnostics measuring the conditions of output power. The TPS272C45 integrates many diagnostic features that enable modules to provide predictive maintenance and intelligence power monitoring to the system.

# 9.3.4.1 Current Sense
The SNS output can be used to sense the load current through either channel. The SNS pin outputs a current that is proportional to the load current through either channel, depending on the state of the SEL pin. This current is sourced into an external resistor to create a voltage that is proportional to the load current. This voltage can be measured by an ADC or comparator and used to implement intelligent current monitoring for a system. To ensure accurate sensing measurement, RSNS must be connected to the same ground potential as the μC ADC.
The SNS pin output is controlled by the SEL pin. If SEL pin is low, SNS outputs load current proportional to channel 1, whereas if SEL is high SNS outputs load current proportional to channel 2.
Equation 3 shows the transfer function for calculating the load current from the SNS pin current. ISNSI = IOUT / KSNS. KSNS is defined in the Specifications section.

# 9.3.4.1.1 RSNS Value
By looking at these pins, it is possible to detect where the fault has occurred. The method to identify the channel that caused the FLT signal is as follows when an MCU is monitoring the SNS pin output. If the SNS is signaling a fault (with ISNSFH current output) while SEL=LO, then the fault is in channel 1, whereas with SEL=HI, the fault is in channel 2. If SNS pin signals fault with.# 9.3 Fault Mode
The method to identify the channel that caused the FLT signal is as follows when an MCU is monitoring the SNS pin output. If the SNS is signaling a fault (with ISNSFH current output) while SEL=LO, then the fault is in channel 1, whereas with SEL=HI, the fault is in channel 2. If SNS pin signals fault with SEL at either LO or HI, then both channels are faulted. As discussed earlier, the type of faults (whether it is overcurrent, overtemperature or open-load) can be determined by the state of EN input in each channel.

# 9.3.4.2.1 Fault Event Diagrams
The LATCH, SEL, DIA_EN, and ENx pins are controlled by the user. The timing diagrams represent possible use-cases.# 9.3.4.2.1 Fault Event Diagrams
All timing diagrams assume that the SEL pin is low to measure channel one behavior on the SNS pin. 
DIA_EN and SEL pins have no effect on the FLT (versions A, B, C) or FLT1, FLT2 (version D) pin 
output.
The LATCH, SEL, DIA_EN, and ENx pins are controlled by the user. The timing diagrams represent 
possible use-cases.

# 9.3.4.2.2 FLT Pin Behavior (Versions A, B, C)
As shown in the diagram, the device fault reporting behavior in the event of a fault in channel 2 (only) with LATCH and SEL 
pin set to LO is shown. As shown, the fault signaling is deactivated when EN is toggled (in this case from HI to LO to 
HI). The faulted channel can be determined by toggling the EN pin with a short pulse (less than 10-us wide) that 
does not affect the output of the channel.

# 9.3.4.2.3 FLT Pin Behavior With an Overcurrent Event On Channel Enable (Versions A, B,C)
The diagram shows the device fault reporting behavior in the event of an overcurrent fault when EN goes high. As 
shown, the fault signaling is active only after the initial inrush current limit phase is complete.

# 9.3.4.2.4 Current Limit – Latched Behavior
The diagram shows the device fault and retry behavior when there is a slow creep into an overcurrent event. As 
shown, the switch clamps the current until it hits thermal shutdown, and then the device remains latched off until 
the LATCH pin is low.

# 9.3.4.2.5 Current Limit – LATCH = 0
The diagram shows the behavior with LATCH tied to GND; hence, the switch retries after the fault is cleared and 
tRETRY has expired.

# 9.3.4.2.6 Fault Indication During Retry
When the switch retries after a shutdown event, the fault indication remains until VOUTx has risen to VVS – 1.8 V. 
After VOUTx has risen, the FLT output is reset and current sensing is available. If there is a short-to-ground and 
VOUT is not able to rise, the SNS fault indication remains indefinitely. 

# 9.3.4.3 Short-to-Supply or Open-Load Detection
The TPS272C45 is capable of detecting short-to-supply and open-load events regardless of whether the switch 
is turned on or off, however the two conditions use different methods to signify fault. This feature enables 
systems to recognize mis-wiring or wire-break events.# 9.3.4.3 Short-to-Supply or Open-Load Detection
The TPS272C45 is capable of detecting short-to-supply and open-load events regardless of whether the switch is turned on or off, however the two conditions use different methods to signify fault. This feature enables systems to recognize mis-wiring or wire-break events.

# 9.3.4.3.1 Detection With Switch Enabled
When the switch is enabled, the short-to-supply and open-load conditions are detected through the current sense feature. In both cases, the load current drops from the nominal value and instead be measured as close to zero. By measuring load current through the SNS pin, this state can be recognized.

# 9.3.4.3.2 Detection With Switch Disabled
While the switch is disabled and DIA_EN high, an internal comparator watches the condition of VOUT. The TPS272C45 includes a nominally 150-kΩ pull-up resistor from OUT pin to VS pin in series with a switch controlled by the DIA_EN signal. So, if the load is disconnected (open load condition) or there is a short to supply the VOUT voltage is pulled towards VVS. In either of these events, the internal comparator measures VOUT as higher than the open load threshold (VOL,off) and a fault is indicated on the FLT pin (Version A) or FLTx pins (Version D) and on the SNS pin (only for versions A, B, C). No external component is required in most cases, however if there is a pull-down resistor to GND on VOUT, an additional external pull-up resistor can be necessary to bias VOUT appropriately.
Open load fault signaling on the SNS and the internal pull-up on OUT is enabled only if DIA_EN is set HI. To detect open-load threshold at higher pull-down load current, an external pull-up resistor (and potentially a switch) can be needed.
While the switch is disabled, the fault indication mechanisms continuously represent the present status. For example, if VOUT decreases from greater than VOL_off to less than VOL_off, the fault indication is reset. Additionally, the fault indication is reset upon the falling edge of DIA_EN (for SNS pin) or the rising edge of EN.

# 9.3.4.4 Current Sense Resistor Sharing
Multiple high-side devices can use the same RSNS as shown in 图 9-19. This action reduces the total number of passive components in the system and the number of ADC terminals that are required of the microcontroller.

# 9.4.4. Fault
The FAULT state is entered if a fault shutdown occurs (thermal shutdown or current limit). After all faults are cleared, the LATCH pin is low, and the retry timer has expired, the device transitions out of FAULT state. If the EN pin is high, the switch re-enables. If the EN pin is low, the switch remains off.

# 10. Application and Implementation
The TPS272C45 is designed for a variety of applications including being used in devices that have a need for overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent, excessive thermal temperature, open and short circuit protection. The TPS272C45 can operate in a number of states that are described below.

# 10.1.1. IEC 61000-4-5 Surge
The TPS272C45 is designed to survive against IEC 61000-4-5 surge using external TVS clamps. The device is rated to 48 V ensuring that external TVS diodes can clamp below the rated maximum voltage of the TPS272C45. Above 48 V, the device includes VDS clamps to help shunt current and ensure that the device survives the transient pulses. Depending on the class of the output, TI recommends that the system has a# 10.1.1 IEC 61000-4-5 Surge
The TPS272C45 is designed to survive against IEC 61000-4-5 surge using external TVS clamps. The device is rated to 48 V ensuring that external TVS diodes can clamp below the rated maximum voltage of the TPS272C45. Above 48 V, the device includes VDS clamps to help shunt current and ensure that the device survives the transient pulses. Depending on the class of the output, TI recommends that the system has a SMBJ36A or SMCJ36A between VS and module GND.

# 10.1.2 Inverse Current
Inverse current occurs when 0 V < VVS < VOUT. In this case, current can flow from VOUT to VS. Inverse current cannot be caused by a purely resistive load. However, a capacitive or inductive load can cause inverse current. For example, if there is a significant amount of load capacitance and the VS node has a transient droop, VOUT can be greater than VS. The TPS272C45 does not detect inverse current. When the switch is enabled, inverse current passes through the switch. When the switch is disabled, inverse current can pass through the MOSFET body diode. The device continues operating in the normal manner during an inverse current event.

# 10.1.3 Loss of GND
The ground connection can be lost either on the device level or on the module level. If the ground connection is lost, both the channel outputs are disabled irrespective of the EN input level. If the switch was already disabled when the ground connection was lost, the outputs remain disabled even when the channels are enabled. The steady state current from the output to the load that remains connected to the system ground is below the level specified in the Specifications section of this document. When the ground is reconnected, normal operation resumes.

# 10.1.4 Paralleling Channels
If an application requires lower power dissipation than is possible with a 45-mΩ switch, the TPS272C45 can have both channel outputs and ENx pins tied together to function as a single 22.5-mΩ high side switch. In this case, there is some decrease in ISNS and ILIM accuracy, however the device functions properly.

# 10.1.5 Thermal Information
When outputting current, the TPS272C45 heats up due to the power dissipation. The transient thermal impedance curve can be used to determine the device temperature during a pulse current of a given duration (time). This ZθJA value here corresponds to a JEDEC standard 2s2p thermal test PCB with no thermal vias.

# 10.2 Typical Application
This application example demonstrates how the TPS272C45 device can be used as output switches in a digital output module. In this example, consider an 8-channel module with a maximum output current capability of 2 A per channel.

# 10.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure

# 10.2.2.1 RILIM Calculation
In this application, the TPS272C45 must allow for the maximum DC current with margin but minimize the energy in the switch and the load on the input supply during a fault condition by minimizing the current limit. The nominal current limit must be set such that the worst case (lowest) current limit is higher than the maximum load current (2 A). Because the lower limit is 23% below the typical value, for this application, the best ILIM set point is approximately 2.6 A for both channels. The below equation allows you to calculate the RILIM value that is placed from the ILIMx pins to GND pin of the device. RILIM is calculated in kΩ. RILIM = KCL / ICL (3) The KCL value in the Specifications section is 20.5 A × kΩ. So the calculated value of RILIM closest 2% resistor is 7.87 kΩ.

# 10.2.2.2 Diagnostics
If the load is disconnected due a break in the connecting wire, an alert is desired. Open-load detection can be performed in the switch-enabled state with the current sense feature of the TPS272C45 device. Similarly in the off-state, a check for wire break can be performed. Under open load condition, with the DIA_EN set high, the current in the SNS pin is the fault current and the can be detected from the sense voltage measurement.

# 10.2.2.2.1 Selecting the RISNS Value
The load current measurement up to 2.4 A ensures that even in the event of a overcurrent but below the set current limit, the MCU can register and react by turning off the FET while the low level of 50 mA allows for accurate measurement of low load currents and enable the distinction open load faults from nominal load currents. The RSNS resistor value can be selected such that the largest diagnosable load current puts the SNS pin voltage (VSNS) less than the ADC full-scale. With this design, any ADC value that shows full scale (FS) can be considered a fault. Additionally, the RSNS resistor value must ensure that the smallest diagnosable load current does not cause VSNS to fall below at a least a few LSB of the ADC. With the given example values, a 2.4-kΩ sense resistor satisfies both requirements shown in 表 10-4.

| LOAD (A) | SENSE RATIO | ISNS (mA) | RSNS (Ω) | VSNS (V) | % of 5-V ADC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.4 | 1200 | 2.0 | 2400 | 4.8 | 96% |
| 0.024 | 1200 | 0.02 | 2400 | 0.048 | 0.96% (9 LSB) |
---table end---
# 10.2.2.2.1 Selecting the RISNS Value

# 10.2.3 Application Curves
Upon enabling our device into a capacitive load, TPS272C45 defaults the current limit to 2 times ICL for a period of time programmed set by ILIMD. In 图 10-4, TPS272C45 charges a 1-mF capacitor using the inrush control function.# 10.2.3 Application Curves
Upon enabling our device into a capacitive load, TPS272C45 defaults the current limit to 2 times ICL for a period 
of time programmed set by ILIMD.
If the device has a no-load case due to an open load or wire-break, the device registers the fault even in an 
off-state if the DIA_EN pin is high. 
If the output of the TPS272C45 is short-circuited, the device protects the system from failure. Depending on 
RILIM, the current limit set-point varies.
In the event a short is applied to the output while a load is being driven, the device activates its fast trip 
comparator and shutdown the output to limit the inrush current. The device then immediately re-enables into the 
short and limit the current to the programmed current limit value.

# 10.3 Power Supply Recommendations
# 10.3 Power Supply Recommendations
The TPS272C45 device is designed to operate in a 24-V industrial system. The allowed supply voltage range 
(VS pin) is 6 V to 36 V as measured at the VSpin with respect to the GND pin of the device. In this range 
the device meets full parametric specifications as listed in the Electrical Characteristics table. The maximum 
continuous operating voltage is 36 V. The device is also designed to withstand voltage transients beyond this 
range. The device version A requires an external power supply input in the range 3.0 V to 5.5 V. The C and 
D versions of the device have an secondary internal regulator (nominally 3.3 V) but an external supply can be 
optionally provided at the VDD pin to lower the power dissipation in the IC. Version B always use an internal 
3.3V regulator, so a single 24V supply (VS pin) is sufficient.
---table begin---
Table tile: Operating Voltage Range
| Supply voltage pin | Input Supply Voltage Range | Note |
|---|---|---|
| VS | 6 V to 36 V | Nominal supply voltage, all parametric specifications apply. The device is completely short-circuit protected up to 125°C. |
| VDD | 3.0 to 5.5 V | Required for version A, and optional for versions C and D. A DC/DC converter supply reduces the overall power dissipation. When the device is configured to support an external regulator connected to VDD, it is required that the supply input for the external regulator is derived from the same VS supply of TPS272C45 to ensure the outputs disable during loss of supply. Reference Figure 9-6 for external supply configuration.

# 10.4 Layout

# 10.4.1 Layout Guidelines
To achieve optimal thermal performance, connect the exposed pad to a large copper pour. On the top PCB layer, 
the pour can extend beyond the package dimensions as shown in the example below. In addition to this, TI 
recommends to also have a GND plane either on one of the internal PCB layers or on the bottom layer.
Vias must connect this plane to the top GND pour.
Ensure that all external components are placed close to the pins. Device current limiting performance can be 
harmed if the RILIM is far from the pins and extra parasitics are introduced.
